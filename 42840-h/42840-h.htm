<h1 title="">SISTERS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">HOW IT BEGAN</span></h2>
<p>Gold and blue were the colors that predominated
on one glorious April day. Gold were the fields of
poppies that carpeted the foothills stretching down
to the very edge of Rocky Point, against which the
jewel-blue Pacific lapped quietly. It was at that
hour of the tides when the surf is stilled.</p>
<p>A very old adobe house surrounded on three sides
by wide verandas, the pillars of which were eucalyptus
logs, stood about two hundred feet back from
the point. Rose vines, clambering at will over the
picturesque old dwelling, were a riot of colors.
There was the exquisite pink Cecil Brunner in delicate,
long-stemmed clusters; Gold of Ophir blossoms
in a mass glowing in the sunshine, while intertwined
were the vines of the star-like white Cherokee and
Romona, the red.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Mingled with their fragrance was the breath of
heliotrope which grew, bushwise, at one corner so
luxuriantly that often it had to be cut away lest it
cover the gravel path which led around the house
to the orchard. There, under fruit trees that were
each a lovely bouquet of pearly bloom, stood row
after row of square white hives, while bees, busy at
honey gathering, buzzed everywhere.</p>
<p>Now and then, clear and sweet, rose the joyous
song of mating birds.</p>
<p>A little old woman, seated in a rustic rocker on
the western side porch, dropped her sewing on her
lap and smiled on the scene with blissful content.
What a wonderful world it was and how happy she
and Silas had been since Jenny came. She glanced
across the near gardens, aglow with early bloom, to
a patch of ploughed brown earth where an old man
was cultivating between rows of green shoots, some
of them destined to produce field corn for the cow
and chickens, and the rest sweet corn for the sumptuous
table of Mrs. Poindexter-Jones.</p>
<p>Then the gaze of the little old woman continued
a quarter of a mile along the rocky shore to a grove
of sycamore trees, where stood the castle-like home of
the richest woman in Santa Barbara township. Only
the topmost turrets could be seen above the towering
treetops. The vast grounds were surrounded by a
high cypress hedge, and, not until he reached the
wrought iron gates could a passer-by obtain a view
of the magnificence that lay within. But the little
old woman knew it all in detail, as she had been
housekeeper there for many years, until, in middle-age,
she had married Silas Warner, who managed
the farm for Mrs. Algernon Poindexter-Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>For the past fifteen years the happy couple had
lived in the old adobe house at Rocky Point, while
at Poindexter Arms, as the beautiful estate was
named, there had been a succession of housekeepers
and servants, for their mistress was domineering and
hard to please.</p>
<p>Of late years the grand dame had seldom been
seen by the kindly old farmer, Si Warner and his
wife, for Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had preferred to
live in her equally palatial home in San Francisco
overlooking the Golden Gate.</p>
<p>She visited Santa Barabra periodically, merely to
assure herself that her orders were being carried out
by the servants left in charge of Poindexter Arms
and Rocky Point farm. Often Mrs. Si Warner did
not catch a glimpse of their employer on these fleeting
visits, and yet she well knew that the imperious
mistress of millions was linked more closely than she
liked to remember to the old couple at Rocky Point.</p>
<p>As she resumed her sewing, memory recalled to
her that long ago incident which, by the merest
chance, had made the proud woman and the humble,
sharers of a secret which neither had cared to
divulge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>It had been another spring day such as this, only
they had all been younger by fourteen years.</p>
<p>While ploughing in the lot nearest the highway,
Farmer Si had noticed a strange equipage drawn to
one side of the road. He thought little of it at first,
believing it to be a traveling tinsmith, as the canopied
wagon was evidently furnished with household utensils,
but, when an hour later, he again reached that
side of the field and saw the patient horse still standing
there with drooping head and no one in sight,
his curiosity was aroused, and, leaping over the rail
fence, he went to investigate.</p>
<p>Under that weather-stained canopy a sad tragedy
had been enacted. On the driver&rsquo;s seat a young man,
clothed in a garb of a clergyman, seemed to be sleeping,
but a closer scrutiny revealed to the farmer that
the Angel of Death had visited the little home on
wheels. For a home it evidently had been. In the
roomier part of the wagon a beautiful little girl of
three sat on a stack of folded bedding, while in a
crude box-like crib a sickly looking infant lay
sleeping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Whenever Mrs. Silas Warner recalled that long
ago day, she again experienced the varying emotions
which had come to her following each other in rapid
succession. She had been ironing when she had seen
a queer canopied equipage coming up the lane which
led from the highway. Believing it to be a peddlar,
who now and then visited their farm, she had gone
to the side porch, there to have her curiosity greatly
aroused by the fact that it was her husband Si who
was on the seat of the driver. Then her surprise had
been changed to alarm when she learned of the three
who were under the canopy. Awe, because she was
in the presence of death, and tender sympathy for
the little ones, who had evidently been orphaned,
mingled in the heart of the woman as she held the
scrawny, crying infant that her husband had given
to her. Even with all these crowding emotions there
had yet been room for admiration, when the little
three-year-old girl was lifted down. The child stood
apart, quiet and aloof. She had heard them say that
her father was dead. She was too young to understand
and so she just waited. A rarely beautiful
child, with a tangled mass of light brown, sun-glinted
hair hanging far below her shoulders, and
wide, wondering brown eyes that were shaded with
long curling lashes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>But still another emotion had been stirred in the
heart of Susan Warner, for a most unexpected and
unusual visitor had at that moment arrived. A coach,
bearing the Poindexter Arms, turned into the lane,
and when the liveried footman threw open the door,
there sat no less a personage than the grand dame,
Mrs. Algernon Poindexter-Jones, on one of her very
infrequent visits to the farm which belonged to her
estate. She had been charmed with the little girl,
and after having heard the story, she announced that
she would keep the child until relatives were found.
Then she was driven away, without having stated
her errand, and accompanying her, still quietly aloof,
rode the three-year-old girl. A doctor and coroner
soon arrived, having been summoned by Mrs. Poindexter-Jones.
The latter had searched the effects of
the dead man and had found an unfinished letter
addressed to a bishop in the Middle West. In it the
man had told of his wife&rsquo;s death, and that he was
endeavoring to keep on with his traveling missionary
work in outlying mountain districts, but that his
heart attacks were becoming threateningly more frequent.
&ldquo;There is no relative in all the world with
whom to leave Gwynette, who is now three, and little
Jeanette, who is completing her first year.&rdquo; No
more had been written.</p>
<p>After the funeral Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had announced
that she would adopt the older child and
that, if they wished, the farmer and his wife might
keep the scrawny baby on one condition, and that
was that the girls should never be told that they were
sisters. To this the childless couple had rejoicingly
agreed. The doctor and coroner had also been sworn
to secrecy. The dead man&rsquo;s effects were stored in
the garret above the old adobe and the incident was
closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Mrs. Poindexter-Jones left almost at once for
Europe, where she had remained for several years.</p>
<p>Tenderly loved, and nourished with the best that
the farm could produce, the scrawny, ill-looking infant
had gradually changed to a veritable fairy of
sunshine. &ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; as they called her, feeling that
Jeanette was a bit too grand, walked with a little
skipping step from the time that she was first sure
that she would not tumble, and looked up, with
laughter in her lovely eyes, that were the same liquid
brown as were her sister&rsquo;s, and tossed back her long
curls that were also light brown with threads of sunlight
in them. And ever after, there were little
skipping steps to her walk, and, when she talked, it
seemed as though at any moment she might break
into song.</p>
<p>Jenny had never questioned her origin. She had
always been with Granny Sue and Granddad Si, and
so, of course, that proved that she belonged to them.
She was too happy, just being alive, to create problems
for herself to solve, and too busy.</p>
<p>There had been too few children on the neighboring
ranches to maintain a country school, and Jenny
had been too young to send on a bus to Santa
Barbara each day, but her education had not been
neglected, for a charming and cultured young woman
living not far away had taught her through the years,
and she had learned much that other girls of her age
did not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>When the weather was pleasant Jenny, her school
books under her arm, walked to the hill-top home of
her teacher, Miss Dearborn, but during the rainy
season her grandfather hitched their faithful Dobbin
to the old-fashioned, topped buggy and drove her to
her destination in the morning, calling for her in the
late afternoon.</p>
<p>But on one wild March day when Jenny had been
thirteen, an unexpected storm had overtaken her as
she was walking home along the coast highway.</p>
<p>Luckily she had worn her mackintosh, but as she
was passing between wide, treeless meadows that
reached to the sea on one side and a briary hill on
the other, there had been no shelter in sight.</p>
<p>However, a low gray car had soon appeared
around a bend and the driver, a youth whose face
was hidden by cap, collar and goggles, had offered
her a ride. Gladly she had accepted and had been
taken to her home, where, to her surprise, Grandmother
Sue had welcomed the lad with sincerest
pleasure. That had been the first time Jenny Warner
had met Harold, the only son of their employer, Mrs.
Poindexter-Jones.</p>
<p>His visit had brought consternation to the little
family at Rocky Point, for, inadvertently, he had
told the old man that his mother planned selling the
farm when she could find a suitable buyer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The old woman sitting on the side porch dropped
her sewing to her lap as she recalled that long-ago
scene in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The farmer had been for the moment almost
stunned by the news, then looking up at the boy with
a pitiful attempt at a smile, he had said waveringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you see how &rsquo;tis, Harry-boy. We&rsquo;ve
been livin&rsquo; here at Rocky Point so long, it&rsquo;s sort o&rsquo;
got to feelin&rsquo; like home to us, but you tell your ma
that the Warners&rsquo;ll be ready to move when she says
the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had been much affected, and, after assuring
them that perhaps a buyer would not be found,
he had taken his departure.</p>
<p>When he had gone, Jenny had cuddled in her
grandfather&rsquo;s arms and he had held her close. Susan
Warner remembered that the expression on his face
had been as though he were thanking God that they
had their &ldquo;gal&rdquo;. With her irrepressible enthusiasm
the girl had exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the most wonderful plan! Let&rsquo;s buy
Rocky Point Farm, and then it will be all our very
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawsy, child,&rdquo; Susan Warner had remonstrated,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;d cost a power o&rsquo; money, and it&rsquo;s but a few hundred
that we&rsquo;ve laid by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>But Jenny had a notion that she wanted to try out.
&ldquo;Granny, granddad,&rdquo; she turned from first one to
the other and her voice was eager, earnest, pleading:
&ldquo;Every Christmas since I can remember you&rsquo;ve given
me a five-dollar gold piece to be saving for the time
when I might be all alone in the world. I want to
spend them now.&rdquo; Then she unfolded her plan. She
wanted to buy hens and bees. &ldquo;You were a wonderful
beekeeper when you were a boy, granddad,&rdquo; she
insisted. &ldquo;You have told me so time and again, and
I just know that I can sell eggs and honey to the
rich people over on the foothill estates, and then,
when we have saved money enough, we can buy the
farm and have it for our very own home forever
and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old couple knew that this would be impossible,
but, since they had not the heart to disappoint their
darling, the scheme had been tried. Every Saturday
morning during the summer that she had been thirteen,
Jenny, high on the buckboard seat, had driven
old Dobbin up and down the long winding tree-hung
lanes in the aristocratic foothill suburb of Santa
Barbara. At first her wares were only eggs from her
flocks of white Minorka hens, but, when she was
fourteen, jars of golden strained honey were added,
and gradually, among her customers, she came to be
known as &ldquo;The Honey Girl&rdquo; from Rocky Point
Farm. And now Jenny was fifteen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Susan Warner was startled from her day-dreams
by the shrill whistle of the rural mail carrier. Neatly
folding her sewing (and Granny Sue would neatly
fold her sewing if she were running away from a
fire), the old woman went to the side porch nearest
the lane where the elderly Mr. Pickson was then
stopping to leave the Rural Weekly for Mr. Silas
Warner and a note from Miss Isophene Granger for
&ldquo;The Honey Girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s a fresh order for honey or eggs or
such,&rdquo; the smiling old woman told him. The mail
carrier agreed with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon &rsquo;tis! There&rsquo;s a parcel o&rsquo; new girls over
to the seminary,&rdquo; was his comment as he turned his
horse&rsquo;s head toward the gate, then with a short nod
he drove away.</p>
<p>Susan Warner went back into the kitchen, and,
feeling sure that the note was not of a private nature,
she unfolded the paper and read the message, which
was couched in the formal language habitually used
by the principal of the fashionable seminary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Isophene Granger desires six dozen eggs to
be delivered this afternoon not later than five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman glanced at the clock. &ldquo;Tut! Tut!
And here it&rsquo;s close to three. I reckon I&rsquo;d better be
gatherin&rsquo; the eggs this once. Jenny says it&rsquo;s her
work, but it&rsquo;ll be all she can do to get there, with
Dobbin to hitch and what not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Taking her sunbonnet from its hook by the kitchen
door, the old woman went out to the barnyard where,
in neat, wired-in spaces, there were several flocks of
white Minorka hens. After filling the large basket
that she carried with eggs, Susan Warner returned
through the blossoming orchard, and although she
was unconscious of it, she smiled and nodded at the
bees that were so busily gathering honey; then she
thought of her girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lovin&rsquo; child that she is!&rdquo; The faded blue
eyes of the old woman were tender. &ldquo;Si and me
never lets on that her plan can&rsquo;t come to nothin&rsquo;.
&rsquo;Twould nigh break her heart. All told there&rsquo;s not
more&rsquo;n seven hundred now in the bank, an&rsquo; the farm,
when they come to sell it, is like to bring most that
an acre, or leastwise so Pa reckons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But later, as Susan Warner was sorting the eggs
and placing them in boxes holding a dozen each, she
took a more optimistic view of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well to be workin&rsquo; and savin&rsquo;, how-some-ever,&rdquo;
she concluded. &ldquo;Our darlin&rsquo;ll need it all an&rsquo;
more when her granddad an me are took.&rdquo; Then,
before the old woman could wipe away the tears that
always came when she thought of leaving Jenny, her
eyes brightened, and, peering out of a window near
she exclaimed aloud (although there was only a
canary to hear), &ldquo;Wall now, here comes Jenny this
minute, singin&rsquo; and skippin&rsquo; up the lane, like the
world couldn&rsquo;t hold a trouble. Bless the happy heart
of her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">JENNY</span></h2>
<p>Susan Warner turned to beam a welcome at the
apparition standing in the open door of the kitchen.
With the sun back of her, shining through the folds
of her yellow muslin dress and glinting through her
light, wavy brown hair, the girl did indeed look like
a sprite of the springtime, and, to add to the picture,
she held a branch, sweet with apricot blossoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings, Granny Sue!&rdquo; she called gayly. &ldquo;This
is churning day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, &rsquo;tis, Jenny darlin&rsquo;, or leastwise
&rsquo;twould o&rsquo; been &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; for a message Mr. Pickson
fetched over from Granger Place Seminary. There&rsquo;s
some new pupils come sudden like, I reckon, an&rsquo; they
need eggs a day sooner than ordinary. I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em
all packed in the hamper, dearie. You&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to
do but hitch Dobbin and start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto, Granny Sue; but first I must put these
poor blossoms into a jar. I found the branch broken
and just hanging by a shred of bark on that old tree
&rsquo;way down by the fence corner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Jenny took a brown jar from a cupboard as she
talked and filled it with water from the sink pump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be lonely for their home tree, like as not,&rdquo;
she chattered on, &ldquo;but perhaps they&rsquo;ll be a bit glad
when they find that they are to brighten up our home
for a few days. Don&rsquo;t you think maybe they will,
Granny Sue? Don&rsquo;t you think when we can&rsquo;t do the
thing we most want to do, we still can be happy if we
are just alive and doing the most beautiful thing that
is left for us to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was called over her shoulder as she carried
the jar and blossoming branch toward the door
of the living-room. Luckily she did not pause for an
answer, for the little old woman always felt confused
when her girl began such flights of fancy. Had she
been obliged to reply, she no doubt would have said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;taint likely, Jenny, that branch of apricot
flowers even knows it&rsquo;s broken off, an&rsquo; as for that,
the ones that are left will make all the better fruit
with some of &rsquo;em gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the girl was placing the jar on the living-room
center table, close to the book that she had been
reading, Granddad Si entered the kitchen for a drink,
and upon hearing of the message from Miss Granger,
he hurried to the barn to hitch old Dobbin to
the cart, and so, when five minutes later the girl
skipped out, laughing over her shoulder at her grandmother&rsquo;s
admonition to go more slowly, lest she fall
and break the eggs, there was Granddad Si fastening
the last buckles. He straightened up, pushed his
frayed straw hat to the back of his head and surveyed
the girl with pardonable pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, gal,&rdquo; he began, and from the expression
in his eyes she knew just how he would complete the
sentence, and so, laughingly, she put her free hand
over his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, granddad, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t so, not the least bit, and you
mustn&rsquo;t say it again. A stranger might hear you
some time, and what if he should think that I really
believed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old man finished his sentence, even though
the words were mumbled behind the slim white hand
of his girl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Gospel truth, Jenny. I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye! Thar
ain&rsquo;t a gal over to that hifalutin seminary that&rsquo;s half
as purty as yo&rsquo; be. I reckon I know, &rsquo;cause I watch
the whole lot of &rsquo;em when they go down the road on
them parade walks they take, with a teacher ahead
and one behind like they was a flock of geese and had
to have a gooseherd along, which more&rsquo;n like they
are. A silly parcel, allays gigglin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last half of this speech had been more clearly
spoken, for Jenny, having kissed him on the top of
the nose from the wagon step, had climbed into the
cart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>As she was driving away, she called back to him:
&ldquo;Wrong you are, Granddad, for I am only an egg
and honey vender, while they are all aristocrats.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, a second later, she turned again to sing out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Granny I&rsquo;d like a chocolate pudding tonight,
all hidden in Brindle&rsquo;s yellowest cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long after the girl had driven away, the farmer
stood gazing down the lane. An old question had
returned to trouble him:</p>
<p>Was it honest not to tell her that she wasn&rsquo;t their
own kin?</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t do it. It would break all of their
hearts. She was their kin, somehow. No own
grandchild could be dearer. Then he thought of the
other girl, Jenny&rsquo;s sister. He had heard something
that day about her, and he had been mighty sorry
to hear it.</p>
<p>When his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; disappeared from sight, up one
of the tree-shaded lanes leading toward the foothill
estates, Farmer Si turned and walked slowly back to
the kitchen. He delivered Jenny&rsquo;s message about the
chocolate pudding to his wife, who, even then, was
preparing the vegetables for supper. Crossing to the
sink pump, the old man began working the handle up
and down. A rush of crystal clear water rewarded
his effort and, after having quaffed a long refreshing
draught of it, he wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Then, after hanging his hat on its nail by the door,
he sank down in his favorite arm chair close to the
stove and sighed deeply as though he were very
weary. His wife looked at him questioningly and
he said in a voice and manner which were evidently
evasive:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powerful poor weather for gettin&rsquo; the crops
started. Nothin&rsquo; but sunshine this fortnight past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner was briskly beating the eggs needed
for her darling&rsquo;s favorite pudding. When the whirr
had ceased she turned and smiled across the room at
the old man whose position showed that he was dejected.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s worryin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;, Si?&rdquo; The tone of the
old woman&rsquo;s voice promised sympathy if it were
needed. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t about the farm yo&rsquo;re really cogitatin&rsquo;.
I can tell that easy. Thar&rsquo;s suthin&rsquo; else
troublin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;, an&rsquo; yo&rsquo; might as well speak out furst
as last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, yo&rsquo;re close to right, Susan, as I reckon yo&rsquo;
most allays are. I was mendin&rsquo; the fence down by
the highway when ol&rsquo; Pickson drove up an&rsquo; stopped
to pass the time o&rsquo; day, like he generally does, an&rsquo; he
says, says he, &lsquo;Si, have yo&rsquo; heard the news?&rsquo; I w&rsquo;a&rsquo;nt
particular interested, bein&rsquo; as Pickson allays starts off
that a-way, but what he said next fetched me to an
upstandin&rsquo;, I kin tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner had stopped her work to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Mr. Pickson tell you, Si? Suthin&rsquo; that
troubled you?&rdquo; she inquired anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, sort o&rsquo; that way. Mabbe it won&rsquo;t be nuthin&rsquo;
to worry about, and mabbe agin it will. Pickson
said as how Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had gone to some
waterin&rsquo; place over in France for her nerves, an&rsquo; not
wishin&rsquo; to leave her daughter in the big city up north
alone with the servants, she&rsquo;d sent her to stay in the
seminary down here for the time bein&rsquo;, an&rsquo;, what&rsquo;s
more, a flock of her friends from San Francisco
came along of her. Them are the new pupils you
was mentionin&rsquo; a spell ago, as being the reason extra
eggs was needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman stared at her spouse as one spellbound.
When she spoke her voice sounded strained
and unnatural. &ldquo;Si Warner, do yo&rsquo; mean to tell me
our Jenny has gone to fetch eggs for her very own
sister an&rsquo; her friends? They&rsquo;re likely to meet up wi&rsquo;
each other now, arter all these years, an&rsquo; neither will
know who the other really is. Oh, the pity of it, that
one of &rsquo;em should have all that money can buy,
and the other of &rsquo;em ridin&rsquo; around peddlin&rsquo; eggs and
honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old man took a different view of the matter.
&ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if our gal had the pick of the
two places, I reckon she&rsquo;d choose stayin&rsquo; with us.
I reckon she would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Susan Warner&rsquo;s practical nature had again asserted
itself. &ldquo;Wall, there&rsquo;s no need for us to be
figurin&rsquo; about that. Jenny shall never know that she
has a sister. Who is there to tell her? An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
more, she&rsquo;ll never have a chance to choose betwixt
us and the Poindexter-Joneses.&rdquo; Then, as a tender
expression crept into the faded blue eyes, the old
woman added, &ldquo;Jenny wouldn&rsquo;t leave us, Si. No,
not for anyone. I&rsquo;m sartin as to that, but I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo;
she&rsquo;ll never know as she isn&rsquo;t our own. I&rsquo;m sure
hopin&rsquo; that she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">FORLORN ETTA</span></h2>
<p>Dobbin never could be induced to go faster than
a gentle trot and this pace was especially pleasing to
his driver on a day when the world, all the world
that she knew, was at its loveliest. Having left the
coast highway, she turned up the Live-Oak Canon
road and slowly began the ascent toward the foothills.</p>
<p>There was no one in sight for, indeed, one seldom
met pedestrians along the winding lanes in the aristocratic
suburb of Santa Barbara. Now and then a
handsome limousine would pass and Dobbin, drawing
to the far side of the road, would put up his ears
and stare at the usurper. He seemed to consider all
vehicles not horse-drawn with something of disdain.
Then, when it had passed, he again took the middle
of the road, which he deemed his rightful place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbin,&rdquo; the girl sang out to him, &ldquo;what would
you think, some day, if you saw me riding in one of
those fine cars?&rdquo; Then, as memory recalled a certain
stormy day two years previous, Jenny continued, &ldquo;I
never told you, Dobbin, but I did ride in one once.
It was a little low gray car and the boy who drove it
called it a &lsquo;speeder.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as Dobbin seemed to consider this conversation
not worth listening to, the girl fell to musing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what became of that boy. Harold P-J,
he called himself, and he said I mustn&rsquo;t forget the
hyphen. He laughed when he said it. There must
have been something amusing about it. He was a
nice boy with such brotherly gray eyes. He hasn&rsquo;t
been back since, I am sure, for he told granddad he
would come to the farm the very next time his
mother permitted him to visit Santa Barbara.&rdquo; Then
Jenny recalled the one and only time that she had
seen Harold&rsquo;s mother. It was when she had been ten.
She had been out in the garden gathering Shasta
daisies to give to Miss Dearborn, her teacher. She
had on a yellow dress that day, she recalled; yellow
had always been her favorite color and she had been
standing knee deep among the flowers with her arms
almost full when the grand coach turned into the
lane. Jenny had often heard Granny Sue tell about
the coach, on the door of which was emblazoned the
Poindexter-Arms, and the small girl, filled with a
natural curiosity, had glanced up as the equipage was
about to pass. But it had not passed, for the only
occupant, a haughty-mannered, handsomely-gowned
woman had pulled on a silken cord which evidently
communicated with the driver&rsquo;s seat, for, almost at
once, the coach had stopped and the woman had
beckoned to the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Jeanette Warner?&rdquo; she had asked
abruptly. The child, making a curtsy, as Miss Dearborn
had said all well-mannered little girls should,
had replied that her name was Jenny. Never would
the girl forget the expression on the handsome face
as the eyebrows were lifted. The grand dame&rsquo;s next
remark, which was quite unintelligible to the child,
had been uttered in a cold voice as though the speaker
were much vexed about something. &ldquo;I am indeed
sorry to find that you are so alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The haughty woman had then jerked on the silken
cord in a most imperious manner and the coach had
moved toward the farmhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Jenny had never told anyone of this meeting, but
her sensitive nature had been deeply hurt by the cold,
disdainful expression in the woman&rsquo;s eyes. She had
sincerely hoped she never again would encounter the
owner of Rocky Point, nor had she done so. Time,
even, had erased from her memory just what Mrs.
Poindexter-Jones had said, since, at the time, the
words had conveyed no real meaning to the child.
All that was left in her heart was a dread of the
woman, and she had been glad, glad that she lived
far away to the north instead of next door.</p>
<p>Suddenly the impulsive girl drew rein. &ldquo;Dobbin,&rdquo;
she exclaimed joyfully, &ldquo;stand still a moment. I want
you to look at that wonderful stone wall around the
Bixby estate. Isn&rsquo;t it the most beautiful thing that
you ever saw with the pink and white cherokee roses,
star-like, all over it?&rdquo; Then she waved her hand
toward an acacia tree beyond the wall that was
golden with bloom, and called out to an invisible
mocking bird that was imitating one lilting song
after another, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that you shout hosannas
of praise. It&rsquo;s such a wonderful world to live in.
Trot along, Dobbin! We must get the eggs to the
seminary before five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tree-shaded, lane-like road they were following
had many a bend in it as it ascended higher and
higher into the foothills, and, as they turned at one
of them, Jenny again addressed her four-footed
companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbin, do hurry! There&rsquo;s that poor forlorn
Etta Somebody who pares potatoes at the seminary.
I see her all crouched down over a pan of vegetables
every time I go into that kitchen to deliver eggs and
honey, but not once has she looked up at me. I know
she&rsquo;s terribly unhappy about something. I don&rsquo;t
believe she even knows that she&rsquo;s living in a wonderful
world where everything is so beautiful that a
person just has to sing. Please do hurry, Dobbin.
I may never get another chance to speak to her and I
want to ask her if she wouldn&rsquo;t like to ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny slapped the reins on the back of the old
dusty-white horse, and, although he at first cast a
glance of indignation over his right shoulder, he decided
to humor his young mistress, and did increase
his speed sufficiently to overtake the tall angular girl
who shuffled as she walked and drooped her shoulders
as though the burden upon them was more than she
could bear. She wore an almost threadbare brown
woolen dress, though the day was warm, and a queer
little hat which suggested to Jenny pictures she had
seen of children in foreign lands. She had one day
heard the cook address the girl as Etta in a voice
that had expressed impatience, and so, pulling on the
rein, Jenny called cheerily, &ldquo;Etta, are you going up
to the seminary? Won&rsquo;t you ride with me? I&rsquo;m
taking the eggs a day early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, whose plain, colorless face was dully
expressionless, climbed up on the seat at Jenny&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;You look awfully fagged and dusty. Have you
been walking far?&rdquo; the young driver ventured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>The strange girl&rsquo;s tone was complaining&mdash;&ldquo;Far?
Well, I should say I have. All the way to Santa
Barbara railway station and back. Folks enough
passed me goin&rsquo; and comin&rsquo;, but you&rsquo;re the first that
offered me a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight miles is a long walk,&rdquo; the young driver
put in, &ldquo;on a day as warm as this&rdquo; Etta&rsquo;s china blue
eyes stared dully ahead. She made no response and
so Jenny again started Dobbin on the upward way.</p>
<p>From time to time she glanced furtively at her
companion, wondering why she was so evidently
miserable.</p>
<p>At last she said, &ldquo;I suppose everyone was in a
hurry. I mean the folks who passed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her companion, with a bitter hatred in her
voice, replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it. Most of &rsquo;em
don&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; to do that has to be done. Rich
folks ridin&rsquo; around in their swell cars, but do you
s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;d give me a lift. Not them! They&rsquo;d
think as how I&rsquo;d poison the air they breathed if I sat
too close. I hate &rsquo;em! I hate &rsquo;em all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Hate was a new word to Jenny and she did not
like it. &ldquo;I suppose some rich folks are that way, but
I don&rsquo;t believe they all are.&rdquo; Then she laughed, her
happy rippling laugh which always expressed real
mirth. &ldquo;Hear me talking as though I knew them,
when I don&rsquo;t. I never spoke to but one rich person
in all my life, and just a minute ago I was wishing
that I never would have to speak to her again.&rdquo;
Jenny wondered why Etta had walked to the railway
station. As they turned the last bend before their
destination was to be reached, she impulsively put
her free hand on the arm of her companion and said,
&ldquo;Etta, would it help any if you told me why you are
so dreadfully unhappy? I don&rsquo;t suppose I could do
anything, but sometimes just talking things over
with someone who wishes she could help, makes it
easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The china blue eyes of the rebellious girl at her
side were slowly turned toward the speaker and in
them was mingled amazement and doubt. Then she
remarked cynically, &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nobody cares what&rsquo;s
making me miserable.&rdquo; But when Jenny succeeded
in convincing the forlorn girl that she, at least, really
did care, the story of her unhappiness was revealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">A PITIFUL PLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; Etta said bitterly, &ldquo;but
I haven&rsquo;t always been miserable. I was happy up to
the time I was ten. I lived with my grandfolks over
in Belgium. My mother left me there while she
came to America. She&rsquo;d heard how money was easy
to get, and, after my father died in the war and the
soldiers had robbed my grandfolks of all they had on
the farm, we had to get money somewheres. That&rsquo;s
why she came, takin&rsquo; all that she&rsquo;d saved for her
passage. How my mother got away out here to
Californy, I don&rsquo;t know, but anyway she did. She
was a cook up in Frisco. Every month she sent
money to my grandfolks. My mother kept writing
how lonesome she was for me and how she was savin&rsquo;
to send for me. The next year I came over with a
priest takin&rsquo; charge of me, but when I got here they
told me my mother had died and they put me in an
orphanage. My grandfolks tried to save money to
send for me to go back to Belgium, but what with
sickness and they bein&rsquo; too old to work the farm, it&rsquo;s
seven years now, an&rsquo; the money ain&rsquo;t saved. Last
year, me bein&rsquo; sixteen, I got turned out o&rsquo; the orphanage
and sent here to work parin&rsquo; vegetables. I don&rsquo;t
get but three dollars a week and board, and I&rsquo;ve been
savin&rsquo; all I can of it. But &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no use. That&rsquo;s why
I walked to the railway station over to Santa Barbara
to ask how much money I&rsquo;d have to save to take me
home to my grandfolks.&rdquo; The girl paused as though
too discouraged to go on.</p>
<p>Jenny had been so interested that she had not even
noticed that Dobbin had stopped to rest at one side
of the steep road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor girl, I&rsquo;m so sorry for you!&rdquo; she
said with a break in her voice. &ldquo;I suppose it takes
a lot of money for the ticket to New York and then
the passage across the Atlantic in one of those big
steamers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone in which her companion answered was
dull and hopeless. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use tryin&rsquo;. I never
can make it. Never! It&rsquo;d take two hundred dollars.
An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve only got a hundred with what my grandfolks
have sent dribble by dribble.&rdquo; The dull, despairing
expression had again settled in the putty-pale
face. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use,&rdquo; she went on apathetically.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t save the whole three dollars a week. I&rsquo;ve
got to get shoes an&rsquo; things. Cook said yesterday
how she&rsquo;d have to turn me out if I didn&rsquo;t get some
decent work dresses; a fashionable seminary like that
couldn&rsquo;t have no slatterns in the kitchen.&rdquo; Then,
after a hard, dry sob that cut deep into the heart of
the listener. Etta ended with &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to do, but it&rsquo;s got to be done soon, whatever
&rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Jenny felt alarmed, she hardly knew why. &ldquo;Oh,
Etta, you don&rsquo;t mean you might take&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
could not finish her sentence. Her active imagination
pictured the unhappy girl going alone to the
coast at night and ending her life in the surf, but to
her surprise Etta looked around as though she feared
she might be overheard; then she said, &ldquo;Yes, I am.
I&rsquo;m going to take one hundred dollars out of the
school safe, and after I&rsquo;ve got over to Belgium I&rsquo;m
going to work my fingers to the bone and send it
back. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do. I&rsquo;ve told &rsquo;em at
the station to keep me a ticket for the train that goes
out tomorrow morning.&rdquo; Then, when she felt, rather
than saw, that her companion was shocked, she said
bitterly, &ldquo;I was a fool to tell you. Of course you&rsquo;ll
go and blab on me.&rdquo; To the unhappy girl&rsquo;s surprise
she heard her companion protesting, &ldquo;Oh, no, no!
I won&rsquo;t tell, Etta. Never, never! But you <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i>
steal. They&rsquo;d put you in prison. But, most of all, it
would be very, very wrong. You can&rsquo;t gain happiness
by doing something wicked. I just <i>know</i> that
you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after a thoughtful moment, Jenny amazed
her companion by saying, &ldquo;I have some money that
is all my very own. If Granny and Granddad will
let me, I&rsquo;ll loan you a hundred dollars, because I
<i>know</i> you&rsquo;ll pay it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Radiant joy made Etta&rsquo;s plain face beautiful, but
it lasted only a moment and was replaced by the usual
dull apathy. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let you, an&rsquo; they shouldn&rsquo;t.
I just told you as how I was plannin&rsquo; to steal, and
if I&rsquo;d do that, how do you know I&rsquo;d ever send back
your hundred dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you would,&rdquo; was the confident reply.
Jenny then urged Dobbin to his topmost speed, and
since he had rested quite a while, he did spurt ahead
and around a bend to the very crest of the low foothill
where stood the beautiful buildings of the seminary
in a grove of tall pine trees. The majestic view
of the encircling mountain range usually caused
Jenny to pause and catch her breath, amazed anew
each time at the grandeur of the scene, but her
thoughts were so busy planning what she could do
to help this poor girl that she was unconscious of
aught else.</p>
<p>They turned into the drive, which, after circling
among well-kept gardens and lawns, led back of the
main building to the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful late and I&rsquo;ll get a good tongue lashin&rsquo;
from the cook but what do I care. This&rsquo;ll be the last
night she&rsquo;ll ever see me.&rdquo; Jenny glancing at her
companion, saw again the hard expression in the
face that had been so radiant with joy a few
moments before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m going to loan her my
money,&rdquo; Jenny thought. &ldquo;And maybe she&rsquo;s right.
Maybe Granny and Granddad will think I ought
not.&rdquo; But what she said aloud was: &ldquo;Etta, let me
go in ahead and I&rsquo;ll fix things up if you&rsquo;re late and
going to be scolded.&rdquo; And so, when they climbed
from the wagon, it was the girl from Rocky Point
Farm who first entered the kitchen. &ldquo;Good afternoon,
Miss O&rsquo;Hara,&rdquo; she called cheerily to the
middle-aged Irish woman who was taking a roast
from the huge oven of the built-in range.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; was the ungracious reply, &ldquo;so <i>you</i> had
that lazy good-for-nothing out ridin&rsquo;, did you?&rdquo; The
roast having been replaced, the cook turned and
glared at Etta, her arms akimbo. &ldquo;Here &rsquo;tis, five
o&rsquo;clock to the minute and not a potato pared. How
do you suppose I&rsquo;m going to serve a dinner for the
young ladies at six-thirty and all that pan of peas
to shell besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etta was about to reply sullenly when Jenny, who
had placed her basket of eggs on one end of a long
white table, turned to say: &ldquo;Miss O&rsquo;Hara, I want
to ask you a favor. If I stay and help Etta get the
vegetables ready, will you let her come over to my
house to supper? Won&rsquo;t you please, Miss O&rsquo;Hara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny smiled wheedlingly at the middle-aged Irish
woman who had always had a soft spot in her heart
for &ldquo;the honey girl,&rdquo; and so she said reluctantly,
&ldquo;Wall, if it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re wishin&rsquo;, though the Saints
alone know what <i>you</i> see in Etta Heldt to be wantin&rsquo;
of her company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the uncomplimentary part of the speech,
Jenny cried joyfully: &ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you,
Miss O&rsquo;Hara! Now give me a big allover apron,
please, for I mustn&rsquo;t soil my fresh yellow muslin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Miss O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s anger had died away, confident
that the peas would be shelled and the potatoes pared
on time. She went about her work humming one of
the Irish tunes that always fascinated Jenny.</p>
<p>Etta, without having spoken a word, took her customary
place and began to pare potatoes, jabbing out
the spots as though she were venting upon them the
wrath which she felt toward the world in general,
but even in her heart there was dawning a faint hope
that somehow, some way, she had come to a gate
on the other side of which, if only she could pass
through, a new life awaited her.</p>
<p>She looked up and out of the window by which
they were seated, when Jenny, pausing a moment
in the pea-shelling, exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, Etta, do see
those pretty girls. Aren&rsquo;t they the loveliest? Just
like a flock of butterflies dancing out there on the
lawn. There are eight, ten, twelve! Oh, my, more
than I can count! How many girls are there now
at the seminary, Miss O&rsquo;Hara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the three that came in today, there&rsquo;s thirty-one,&rdquo;
the cook answered as she broke a dozen eggs
into a pudding which she was stirring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did three new pupils come today? Isn&rsquo;t it late in
the year to start in school? Only two months more
and the long vacation will begin,&rdquo; Jenny turned to
inquire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is late,&rdquo; Miss O&rsquo;Hara replied, then suddenly
she stopped stirring the batter and stared at Jenny
with a puzzled expression in her Irish blue eyes.
&ldquo;When I saw one of &rsquo;em, a haughty, silly minx, I
thought to myself as I&rsquo;d seen her before somewhere&rsquo;s
though I knew I hadn&rsquo;t. Now I know why I thought
that. There&rsquo;s something about you, Jenny Warner,
as looks like her. Folks do look sort of like other
folks once in a while, and be no way related.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny agreed brightly. &ldquo;Yes, Miss O&rsquo;Hara, that&rsquo;s
absolutely true. My teacher has often said that the
reason she has kept on tutoring me is because I look
like a sister she once had. That makes two folks
I resemble, and I suppose likely there are lots more.
What is the new pupil&rsquo;s name. Miss O&rsquo;Hara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that the cook recalled something.
&ldquo;Begorrah, and maybe you know her being as her
ma owns the farm you&rsquo;re living on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny looked up with eager interest. &ldquo;Oh, no,
I didn&rsquo;t even know Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had a
daughter. But I do know the son Harold. That is,
I met him for a few moments once two years ago,
and now I do recall that he mentioned having a sister.&rdquo;
Then, returning to the shelling of the peas,
she concluded with: &ldquo;You know they have not lived
in Santa Barbara lately. I never saw the mother,
that is, only once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not likely to do more than see the
daughter. She wouldn&rsquo;t speak civil to a farmer&rsquo;s
granddaughter.&rdquo; Jenny&rsquo;s bright smile seemed to
reply that it troubled her not at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>For another ten minutes the girls worked silently,
swiftly; then Jenny sprang up, removed her apron
and, as she donned her hat, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Miss
O&rsquo;Hara, you just don&rsquo;t know how grateful I am to
you for having said that Etta might go home to
supper with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the cook regretted having given the permission,
she merely mumbled a rather ungracious
reply.</p>
<p>Etta went up to her room to put on her &ldquo;&rsquo;tother
dress,&rdquo; as she told Jenny, but on reaching there she
bundled all her belongings into an ancient carpet bag,
stole out of a side door and was waiting in the buggy
when Jenny reached it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I sure certain don&rsquo;t see how &rsquo;twas the
ol&rsquo; dragon let me go along with you,&rdquo; Etta Heldt
declared, seeming to breathe for the first time when,
high on the buckboard seat at Jenny&rsquo;s side, old Dobbin
was actually turning out of the seminary gates
that had for many months been as the iron-barred
doors of a prison to the poor motherless, fatherless
and homeless girl. And yet not really homeless, for,
far across the sea on a small farm in Belgium there
was a home awaiting her, and a dear old couple
(Jenny was sure that they were as dear and loving
and lovable as were her own grandparents) yearning
for the return of their only grandchild.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Jenny, who always pictured in detail anything
and everything of which she had but the meagerest
real knowledge, was seeing the old couple going
about, day by day, planning and striving to save
enough to send for their girl, but failing because of
the privation that had been left blightingly in the
trail of the cruel world war. Then her fancy leaped
ahead to the day when Etta would arrive at that
far-away farm.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s musings were interrupted by a querulous
voice at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear nothing I am saying? What do
you see out there between your horse&rsquo;s ears that
you&rsquo;re starin&rsquo; at so steady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny turned a pretty face bright with laughter.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the ears,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;and do forgive
me for not listening to what you were saying.
Oh, yes, I recall now. You wondered what the old
dragon would say when she found you were really
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, more seriously: &ldquo;Truly, Etta, Miss O&rsquo;Hara
isn&rsquo;t dragony; not the least mite. I have sold eggs
and honey to her for two years, long before you
came to be her helper, and she always seemed as glad
to see me as the dry old earth is to see the first rains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, hesitating and slowly thinking ahead that
her words might not hurt her companion, she continued:
&ldquo;Maybe you didn&rsquo;t always try to please Miss
O&rsquo;Hara. Weren&rsquo;t you sometimes so unhappy that
you let it show in your manner? Don&rsquo;t you think
perhaps that may have been it, Etta?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I s&rsquo;posen like&rsquo;s not. How could I help showin&rsquo;
it when I was so miserable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, before Jenny could reply, Etta continued
cynically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to let myself to be any too
cheerful even now. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t likely your grandfolks&rsquo;ll
let you loan me a hundred dollars. How&rsquo;ll they know
but maybe I&rsquo;d never return it. How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny turned and looked full into the china blue
eyes of her companion. The gaze was unflinchingly
returned. Impulsively Jenny reached out a slender
white hand and placed it on the rough red one
near her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etta Heldt,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;I know you will
return my money if it lies within your power to do
it. I also know that when it came to it, you would
not have stolen money from the Granger place safe.
There&rsquo;s something in your eyes makes me know it,
though I can&rsquo;t put it into words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the other girl did not reply, Jenny continued:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> sure certain that I <i>can</i> loan you my money,
of course. I have been saving and saving it for two
years so that I could add it to the money grandpa
had if we needed it to buy Rocky Point Farm, but
the farm hasn&rsquo;t been put on the market, granddad
says, and so I guess we can spare it for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Suddenly and most unexpectedly the girl at her
side burst into tears. &ldquo;Oh, oh, how sweet and good
you are to me. Nobody, nowhere has ever been so
kind, not since I came to this country looking for
mother. When they told me she was dead and had
been buried two days before I got here, and all her
belongings sold to pay for the funeral, nobody was
kind. They just tagged me with a number and sent
me with a crowd of other children out to an orphan
asylum. And there it was just the same: no one
knew me from any of the rest of the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were also tears in her listener&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor Etta, and here I&rsquo;ve been brought up
on love. It doesn&rsquo;t seem fair, someway.&rdquo; Then
slipping an arm comfortingly about her companion,
Jenny said brightly: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep hoping that you
can borrow my money. Look, Etta, we&rsquo;re coming
to the highway now, and that long, long lane beyond
the barred gate leads right up to my home. Don&rsquo;t
cry any more, dearie. I just <i>know</i> that my grandfolks
will help you, somehow. You&rsquo;ll see that they
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, the forlorn Etta took heart and,
after wiping away the tears which had brought infinite
relief to her long pent-up emotions, she turned
a wavering smile toward Jenny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget what all you&rsquo;re trying to do for
me. Never. Never,&rdquo; she ended vehemently. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll have the chance some day to make
up for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the reward that I want is to have you get
home to your grandfolks and be as happy with them
as I am with mine,&rdquo; Jenny called brightly as she
leaped out of the wagon to open up the barred gate.</p>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">FRIENDS IN NEED</span></h2>
<p>Grandma Sue had been often to the side porch
nearest the lane and had gazed toward the highway
wondering why her girl did not return. The supper
had been ready for some time and the specially
ordered chocolate pudding was done to perfection.
At last the old woman hurried back into the kitchen
to exclaim: &ldquo;Wall, I declare to it, if Jenny ain&rsquo;t
fetchin&rsquo; someone home to supper. I reckon its Mis&rsquo;
Dearborn, her teacher, as she sets sech a store by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as Dobbin approached at his best speed (for,
was he not nearing his own supper?) the old woman,
peering from behind the white muslin curtains at a
kitchen window, uttered an ejaculation of surprise.
&ldquo;Silas Warner,&rdquo; she turned wide-eyed toward the
old man, who, in carpet slippers, had made himself
comfortable in his tipped back arm chair to read the
<i>Rural News</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeap, Susan?&rdquo; his tone was one of indifferent
inquiry. He presumed that his spouse was merely
going to affirm what she had already suspected.
Well, even if that were true, all he would have to put
on was the house coat Jenny had made for him. It
never would do to go to the table in shirt sleeves if
teacher&mdash;he rose to carry out this indolently formed
decision when he saw his wife tip-toeing across the
room toward him, her finger on her lips. &ldquo;Shh!
Don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;, Si!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Jenny&rsquo;s
left the horse hitched and she&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; right in and
trailin&rsquo; arter her is a gal totin&rsquo; a hand satchel. Who
do you cal&rsquo;late it can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man hastily slipped on the plaid house coat
and stood waiting, trying not to look too curious
when their girl burst in with, &ldquo;Oh, Granny, Granddad,
this is my friend Etta Heldt. You know I told
you about the girl who pares vegetables up at the
seminary and who always looked so&mdash;so unhappy.&rdquo;
Jenny did not want to say discontented as she had
that other time. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve found out what makes
her unhappy and I&rsquo;ve fetched her over to supper.
Etta, this is my Grandmother Sue and my Granddaddy
Si.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The strange girl sent a half appealing, half frightened
glance at each of the old people and then burst
into tears.</p>
<p>Jenny slipped a protecting arm about her new
friend, as she said by way of explanation: &ldquo;Etta&rsquo;s
all upset about something. I&rsquo;ll take her into my
room to rest a bit, and then I&rsquo;ll come back and tell
you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left alone, the elderly couple looked at each other
in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that poor girl is like the stray kittens
and forlorn dogs our Jenny fetches home so often,&rdquo;
the old woman said softly. &ldquo;I never saw such a
hungerin&rsquo; sort of look in human eyes afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man dropped back into his armed chair
and shook his head as much as to say that their
&ldquo;gal&rsquo;s&rdquo; ways were beyond his comprehension. A
moment later that same &ldquo;gal&rdquo; reappeared and, going
at once to her grandfather, she knelt at his side and
held his knotted work-hardened hand in a clinging
clasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut! Jenny, you&rsquo;re all a-tremble.&rdquo; The old
man always felt deeply moved when the girl he loved
seemed to be troubled. He placed his free hand on
her curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d better start at the beginnin&rsquo;. Me&rsquo;n
your grandma here is powerful curious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>The girl sprang up. &ldquo;Granny dear,&rdquo; she pleaded,
&ldquo;you sit here in your rocker and I&rsquo;ll be close between
you on this stool. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you all and please,
please, please say yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two old people looked lovingly into the eager,
uplifted face of their darling and wondered what
the request was to be. They never had denied their
&ldquo;gal&rdquo; anything she had asked for in the past, but
they had always been such simple desires and so
easily fulfilled. However, there was an expression
in the girl&rsquo;s lovely face that made them both believe
that this was to be no ordinary request.</p>
<p>Jenny glanced from one to another of her grandparents
anxiously, eagerly. Then, taking a hand of
each, she fairly clung to them as her words rushed
and tumbled out, sometimes incoherently, but the
picture was clearly depicted for all that. The two
old people could see the forlorn little Belgian girl
coming alone to America to join the mother who had
died and been buried only two days before the child
reached San Francisco. Then the long dreary years
in a crowded city orphanage where no one really
cared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Grandma Sue began to wipe her eyes with one
corner of her apron at that part of the story. She
was thinking that their own darling might have been
brought up in just such a place had not Grandpa Si
happened to see the canopied wagon on that long ago
day. The girl felt the soft wrinkled hand quivering
in her clasp, and she looked up almost joyfully, for
she believed she had an ally. Then she told of the
time when Etta had reached an age where she could
no longer be kept in the institution and how work
had been procured for her paring vegetables at
Granger Place Seminary. Food and a place to sleep
were about all that orphan girls were given, and so,
although she had tried and tried to save the little
money she earned, she could not, for she had to buy
shoes and clothes.</p>
<p>The old woman nodded understandingly. &ldquo;What
was she savin&rsquo; for, dearie? Anything special?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Grandma Sue, something very special.&rdquo;
Then Jenny told about the feeble old grandparents
far across the sea whose little farm had been laid
waste by the war and how they longed for their
granddaughter to be a comfort in their last days.
At this point Grandpa Si took out his big red bandana
handkerchief and blew his nose hard. He was
thinking what it would mean to them if their Jenny
was far away and couldn&rsquo;t get back. Then, looking
at their &ldquo;gal&rdquo; shrewdly, he asked, &ldquo;Jenny, darlin&rsquo;,
what be yo&rsquo; aimin&rsquo; at? Yo&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t jest tellin&rsquo; this story
sort of random-like, be yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Her tear-brimmed
eyes implored first one and then the other.
Then she explained that it would take one hundred
dollars to pay for Etta&rsquo;s transportation in the
steerage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>How the girl pleaded, her sensitive lips quivering.
&ldquo;Think of it, Grandma Sue, Granddad, only one
hundred dollars to take that poor girl to her old
grandparents who love her so. Won&rsquo;t you let me
loan her that much from the money I&rsquo;ve made selling
eggs and honey? Please, please say that you will.
You&rsquo;ve always told me that it is mine and oh, I do
so want to help Etta.&rdquo; Then, as her surprised listeners
hesitated, she hurried on: &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll pay it back,
every cent, and only the other day, Granddad, you
said you didn&rsquo;t think the farm was going to be sold,
because nothing more had been heard about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes questioned his spouse. Still
tearful, Grandma Sue nodded. Then drawing the
girl to her, she held her close as she said, &ldquo;Silas, I
reckon we owe it to the good Lord to help one of
His poor little children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Granny! O, Grandpa! However can I thank
you?&rdquo; The flushed, happy girl sprang up, kissed
each of them and ran toward the bedroom to tell the
wonderful news to the waiting Etta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">WANTED, A WAITRESS</span></h2>
<p>Such a supper as that had been. Etta&rsquo;s expression
had so completely changed that Grandma Sue
decided that she was almost pretty with her corn-colored
hair and china blue eyes. It was the first
time that Jenny had seen her smile and she found
herself wishing that Miss O&rsquo;Hara could see it also.
They made their plans. Etta was to remain with
them all night. Then early in the morning Granddad
would drive both of the girls to Santa Barbara and
take the money from the bank, then they would go
to the railway station and buy a ticket, both for the
train and the steamer. Jenny was sure that there
were such tickets because she had heard her teacher,
Miss Dearborn, tell about one that she purchased all
the way through to Liverpool. Then there would be
no fear that Etta would lose the money. When she
reached Belgium, Etta promised, oh, so faithfully,
that each month she would send back part of the
hundred. She was so strong. She would work the
farm again. The women over there all worked in
the fields. She knew she would have money to send.
Every time she thought of the great joy in store for
the old couple, she began to cry and laugh at the
same time. But once she had a thought which
brought only frightened tears. What if this voyage
should be like the other? What if her loved ones
would be dead?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>But Jenny had said that she must not think of
that, though they all knew that she would, poor girl,
till the very moment that she reached the farm and
saw her grandparents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll write us all about it, won&rsquo;t you, dearie?&rdquo;
Grandma Sue said.</p>
<p>The chocolate pudding was eaten, but no one
seemed conscious of it. They were all thinking the
same thing and yet with wide variations. Grandma
and Grandpa were being so thankful because they
had Jenny, and that little maid was deciding how
she would tell Miss O&rsquo;Hara when Etta was gone.</p>
<p>Everything happened just as they had planned.
The next day dawned in the silvery mist that so
often veils the seaside mornings in California, but
later it burst into a glory of sunshine, as golden as
the oranges, and sweetly, spicily fragrant with the
breath of the lemon groves they passed as they drove
to Santa Barbara. The money was drawn from the
bank, the ticket, a very long ticket, was procured.
Etta, hardly able to believe that she was really
awake, had expressed her thanks in all the ways that
she knew, and the train at last bore her away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>It was not until Jenny was back in her own farm
home that she told what she planned doing next.
&ldquo;I must drive right over to the seminary and tell
Miss O&rsquo;Hara what has become of Etta. Of course
she hasn&rsquo;t worried yet, because she knew that Etta
was with us over here, but she&rsquo;ll be getting impatient
if there&rsquo;s no one to pare the vegetables and
help her get lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandmother Sue&rsquo;s eyes were opened wide. &ldquo;But,
dearie, this is your very own Saturday. The one
that&rsquo;s for you to do with as you please. I thought
you and Miss Dearborn were goin&rsquo; to drive way up
into the foothills. Wasn&rsquo;t that what you&rsquo;d planned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded brightly. &ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and maybe there&rsquo;ll be time for that later, but first,
I must tell Miss O&rsquo;Hara about Etta&rsquo;s having gone
back to Belgium. I suppose she&rsquo;ll send up to the
orphanage for another helper, but that will take a
day or two, maybe more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Granny Sue said no more and as Dobbin was not
needed on the farm, Jenny again drove up the winding
tree-shaded lane to the crest of the low hill on
the broad top of which stood the picturesque buildings
and grounds of the fashionable school for girls.
This time Jenny drew rein before she entered the
gate and gazed far across the valley to the range of
circling mountains, gray and rugged near the peaks,
but green and tree-clad lower down. Jenny always
felt, when she gazed at those majestic mountains,
the same awe that others do in a great cathedral, as
though she were in the real presence of the Creator.
&ldquo;Father, God,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I thank Thee that
at last Etta is really going home.&rdquo; Then she turned
in at the gate.</p>
<p>As Jenny had feared, Miss O&rsquo;Hara was becoming
very wrathful because of the delayed return of her
helper, and when the kitchen door opened, she
whirled about, a carving knife in her hand and a
most threatening expression on her plain Irish face.
When she saw who had entered, the expression
changed, but her sharp blue eyes were gazing back
of the girl as though to find one whom she believed
was purposely lingering outside until a just wrath
were somewhat appeased. But when Jenny turned
and closed the door, Miss O&rsquo;Hara demanded:
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that wench? Are you tryin&rsquo; to shield
her? You can&rsquo;t do it! She&rsquo;d ought to&rsquo;ve been here
two hours back. Me with all the silver to clean and
the vegetables to pare.&rdquo; Then, noting a happiness
like a morning glow in the face of the girl, the
woman concluded: &ldquo;Well, say it out, whatever &rsquo;tis!
But first let me tell you, I&rsquo;m <i>through</i> with that
ne&rsquo;er-do-well. I set myself down right in the middle
of the mornin&rsquo; and wrote to that orphanage place
tellin&rsquo; &rsquo;em they&rsquo;d have to find work elsewhere for
Etta Heldt, and I&rsquo;d be obliged to &rsquo;em if they&rsquo;d send
me another girl as soon as they could. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
more, I made it plain that I didn&rsquo;t want any sour
face this time. I want someone who&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; and
agreeable, that&rsquo;s what! So, if that minx is waitin&rsquo;
to hear what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;, you might as well fetch her
in and let&rsquo;s have it out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>To the amazement of the irate woman, Jenny
clapped her hands girlishly and then, skipping forward,
gave Miss O&rsquo;Hara an impulsive hug as she
cried: &ldquo;Oh, oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you feel that way about
it! Then you won&rsquo;t mind so terribly because Etta
Heldt is gone&mdash;gone for good, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss O&rsquo;Hara stared blankly. &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s she gone to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny glanced at the clock. It was nearing noon
and she knew that the cook had little time for idle
visiting, and so she said briskly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come over to
help. I&rsquo;ll put on Etta&rsquo;s apron and do anything you
want done, and while we&rsquo;re working, I&rsquo;ll tell you the
whole sad story, because, Miss O&rsquo;Hara, it is awfully
sad, and I do believe if you had known it, you would
have been sorrier for Etta, and maybe, a little more
patient.&rdquo; Then, fearing that this might offend her
listener, the tactful girl hurried on with: &ldquo;I know
how kind you can be. No one knows better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>The cook, who had turned back to the slicing of
cold meat, which had been the reason for the carving
knife, merely grunted at this. She was not sure but
that a little of her own native blarney was being
applied to her. But she answered in a pleasanter
voice to the girl&rsquo;s repeated inquiry: &ldquo;What shall
I do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might be fixin&rsquo; the salad. You&rsquo;ll find
the mixin&rsquo;s for it all in the icebox up top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodie!&rdquo; Jenny skipped to the box as she
spoke: &ldquo;I adore making things pretty, and salads
give one a chance more than most anything else,
don&rsquo;t you think so, Miss O&rsquo;Hara?&rdquo; She had lifted
the cover and was peering in where, close to the ice,
lay the cheesecloth bag of crisped lettuce and a bowl
of tiny cooked beets. These she carried to the long
white table as she asked: &ldquo;May I prepare it just
as I want to, Miss O&rsquo;Hara, or have you some special
way of doing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix it to suit yourself,&rdquo; was the ungrudgingly
given response. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find all sort of bowls for it
in the pantry, you&rsquo;ll need four, there being four
tables.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Jenny chose pretty glass bowls and set about making
as artistic a salad as she could, and, while she
worked, she told the whole story to a listener who
at first was merely curious, but who gradually became
interested and finally sympathetic. &ldquo;Well, I
sure certain wish I&rsquo;d known about her comin&rsquo; to this
country and findin&rsquo; her mother dead. Like as not
I&rsquo;d have tried some to cheer her up. As I look back
on it now, I wasn&rsquo;t any too patient with her. It&rsquo;ll
be a lesson to me, that&rsquo;s what it will. When the
next orphan comes to this kitchen, I&rsquo;ll try to make
it as home-like for her as I can.&rdquo; Then the cook
recalled her own troubles. &ldquo;How-some-ever, I wish
Etta Heldt had given me notice. Here I&rsquo;ll be without
a helper for no one knows how long, a week
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, having heaped a glass bowl with a most
appetizing salad, stepped back to admire it. Then
she revealed her plan. &ldquo;Miss O&rsquo;Hara, if you&rsquo;ll let
me, I&rsquo;ll come right over after school every day and
do Etta&rsquo;s work until you can get another helper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss O&rsquo;Hara again turned, another knife in her
hand, as she had been cutting bread. &ldquo;Jenny Warner,
are you meaning that? Will you help out for
a few days? Well, the Saints bless the purty face
of you as they&rsquo;ve done already. I only wish I could
have a helper all the time as cheery as you are. I
could get on with after-school help. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,
on a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, glancing at the clock, she continued: &ldquo;Well,
if &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t eleven-thirty all ready. Here, cut the bread,
will you, Jenny, while I go upstairs and see if one
of the maids won&rsquo;t help with the servin&rsquo; today?
I can&rsquo;t be in the kitchen dishin&rsquo; up, an&rsquo; in the dinin&rsquo;
room at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Jenny, glad to assist in any way, finished the task,
and then wandered to a window near to await further
orders. She heard a gong ringing somewhere
in the big school. Then a side door opened and a
bevy of girls, about her own age, trooped out on the
lawn for a half hour of recreation before lunch.
How pretty they were, nearly all of them, the
watcher thought. By their care-free, laughing faces
she concluded that they had none of them known a
sorrow or felt a feather weight of responsibility.
They had come from homes of wealth, Jenny knew,
where they had had every pleasure and luxury their
hearts could desire. But she did not envy them.
Where in all the wide world was there a home more
picturesque than her very own old adobe farmhouse,
overgrown with blossoming vines, with the ever-changing
ocean and the rocky point in front, and at
the back the orchard, which, all the year round, was
such a delight. And who could they have in their
rich homes more lovable than Granny Sue and
Grandpa Si? There couldn&rsquo;t be any one more lovable
in all the land. Then the watcher wondered
which one of the girls was Harold P-J&rsquo;s sister.
&ldquo;Proud and domineering,&rdquo; Miss O&rsquo;Hara had said
that she was. Maybe she was that tall girl who had
drawn apart from the rest with two companions.
She carried herself haughtily and there was a smile
on her face that Jenny did not like. It was as though
she were accompanying it with sarcastic comment
about the other girls. The two who were with her
glanced in the direction which their leader had indicated.
Jenny did also and saw a shy-looking girl
dressed far simpler than the others, whose light
brown hair hung straight down, fastened at her
neck by a plain brown ribbon. &ldquo;She must be a new
pupil, too,&rdquo; Jenny decided, &ldquo;for she doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be acquainted with any of the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>At that moment Miss O&rsquo;Hara returned, more
flustered than she had been an hour earlier, if that
were possible. &ldquo;The de&rsquo;il himself is tryin&rsquo; to fret
me, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;That silly Peg
Hanson&rsquo;s had a letter and there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in it that
upset her so, she took a fit of cryin&rsquo; and now she&rsquo;s
got one of her blind headaches and can&rsquo;t stand. The
other maid&rsquo;s in the middle of the upstairs cleanin&rsquo;,
being as she had to do Peg&rsquo;s work and her own.
Now, I&rsquo;d like to know <i>who</i> is to wait on that parcel
of gigglin&rsquo; girls this noon? That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Miss O&rsquo;Hara, won&rsquo;t you let me? I&rsquo;m just
wild to have a chance to be near enough to them to
hear what they say. It would be awfully interesting
to me. Please say that I may?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook stared her amazement. &ldquo;Well, now,
what do <i>you</i> know about waitin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; was the merry reply, &ldquo;but my
teacher has often said that I have a good intelligence,
and I do believe, if you&rsquo;d tell me what ought to be
done, I could remember enough to get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook&rsquo;s troubled face broke into a pleased
smile. &ldquo;Jenny Warner,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re as
good as a pinch of soda in sour milk. Somehow
mountain-sized troubles dwindle down to less&rsquo;n
nothin&rsquo; when you take a hand in them.&rdquo; She
glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lunch is served at twelve-thirty,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to both pitch in and get things on the
table, and, while we&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; it, I&rsquo;ll tell you what
you&rsquo;ll have to know about servin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Jenny was in a flutter of excitement half an hour
later as she donned the white cap and apron of the
waitress uniform. They were really very becoming,
and soft brown ringlets peeped out from under the
dainty band-like cap which was tied about her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little waitin&rsquo;-on to be done at noon,
thanks for that,&rdquo; Miss O&rsquo;Hara said. &ldquo;Most things
are on the table, but you&rsquo;ll have to go around and
pour the chocolate and do the things as I told you.
There now! The bell&rsquo;s ringing and I hear those
silly girls laughing, so they&rsquo;re all in the dining
room. Here&rsquo;s the chocolate pot. I haven&rsquo;t filled it
full, fearin&rsquo; it might be too heavy. You&rsquo;ll have to
come back and get more when that&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>With cheeks flushed and eyes shining, as though
she were about to do something which pleased her
extremely, Jenny entered the dining room, where four
tables, surrounded by girls, stood along the walls.
Few there were who even noticed her as she went
from place to place filling the dainty cups with
steaming liquid.</p>
<p>At the first table the girls were chattering about
a theatre party to which they were going with Miss
Granger, and not one of them gave the waitress
more than a fleeting glance. But at the second table
Jenny found the girl she sought. The sister of
Harold P-J, and the daughter of the proud owner
of Rocky Point Farm.</p>
<p>The little waitress knew at once which she was,
for a companion spoke her name. Jenny was disappointed
when she heard her speak. There was a
fretful, discontented note in her voice. And why
should there be, she wondered, as she slowly approached
the end of the table where Gwynette Poindexter-Jones
sat with an intimate friend from San
Francisco at each side.</p>
<p>Surely she had everything her heart could desire.
But evidently this was not true, for, as Jenny drew
nearer, she could hear what was being said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Patricia Sullivan, you make me weary! You
certainly do!&rdquo; she addressed the girl on her right.
&ldquo;How can you say that this is a pleasant place?
When I think of my mother in France luxuriating
in the sort of life I most enjoy, it makes me rebellious.
Sometimes I feel that I just can&rsquo;t forgive her.
What right has a mother to send her daughter to
an out-of-the-way country boarding school if the
girl prefers to be educated abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friend who had been called &ldquo;Patricia&rdquo; now
put in, almost apologetically: &ldquo;But I merely said
that it is a beautiful country, and I repeat that it is.
I think that it is wonderful to be so high up on a
foothill and have a sweeping view of the ocean from
one side of the school and a view of the mountains
from the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shrug, accompanied by an utterance of bored
impatience, then Gwynette&rsquo;s reply: &ldquo;Scenery isn&rsquo;t
what I want, and if I did, I prefer it in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After glancing critically from one table to another,
she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a single girl in this room who belongs
to our class, really. They are all our social inferiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Beulah Hollingsworth, the friend on Gwynette&rsquo;s
left, leaned forward to say in a low voice,
which was audible to Jenny merely because she had
reached the trio and was filling Patricia&rsquo;s cup:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that there is a girl in this school whose
father is a younger son of some titled English
family. She ought to be in our class, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia, whose back was toward the room, could
not turn to look at the other pupils, but suddenly she
recalled one of them, and so, leaning forward, she
also said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Clare Tasselwood. She&rsquo;s stiff enough
at least to be a somebody.&rdquo; Gwynette and Beulah
agreed.</p>
<p>They both glanced at a tall blonde girl at the table
across the room, whose manner was neither disagreeable
nor pleasant, expressing merely bored endurance
of her present existence. Gwynette&rsquo;s face
brightened. &ldquo;I believe you are right. Let&rsquo;s cultivate
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny could hear no more of their conversation
as she had to go back to the kitchen to refill the
silver pot, and when she returned she began to fill
cups at a third table, the one at which sat the supposed
daughter of a &ldquo;younger son.&rdquo; Clare Tasselwood
was so deeply engrossed in her own thoughts
that she seemed scarce aware that the timid girl at
her left was offering her a platter of cold meat. She
took it finally with a brief nod; absently helped herself
to a slice and passed it to the neighbor on her
right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Jenny found herself feeling sorry for the little
girl whom she had noticed at the recreation hour;
the one so simply dressed in brown with whom no
one had been talking, and about whom Gwynette
and her friends had evidently been making uncomplimentary
comment. When the new waitress poured
that girl&rsquo;s cup full of chocolate, the little maid smiled
up at her and said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than ever Jenny&rsquo;s heart warmed toward her.
&ldquo;Poor thing! I&rsquo;d like to be friends with her if she
were not a pupil of this fashionable school. She
looks more like real folks than some of them do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having completed the round with the chocolate
pot, the waitress went out to the kitchen to get
the tray on which were to be heaped the plates after
the first course had been finished. Jenny really
dreaded this task, fearing that she would break
something, and was relieved to find that the upstairs
maid who had been cleaning had come down and
was ready to assist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Jenny,&rdquo; Miss O&rsquo;Hara said, &ldquo;you follow
and give each girl her dessert. Then you come out
and eat your own lunch. After that you can go. Tomorrow,
being Sunday, I can get along alone, and
probably by Monday the new helper&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later Jenny drove away, laughing to herself
over her amusing adventure and eager to tell
Grandma Sue and Granddad Si all about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">JENNY&rsquo;S TEACHER</span></h2>
<p>It was two o&rsquo;clock when Jenny skipped to the
side porch of the Rocky Point farmhouse. Her
grandmother, who was sitting there with her mending
basket at her side, looked up with the welcoming
smile that she always had for the girl. Dropping
down on the wooden bench, back of which hung a
blossom-laden garland of Cecil Brunner rose vine,
Jenny took off her wide, flower-wreathed straw hat
and began fanning her flushed face. The sparkle in
her soft brown eyes told the watcher at once that
something of an unusual nature had occurred. The
old woman dropped her sewing on her lap, pushed
her spectacles up under her lavender-ribboned cap
and then said with a rising inflection: &ldquo;Well, Jenny
dearie, what have you been up to?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>A peal of amused laughter was the girl&rsquo;s first
answer, followed by a series of little chuckles that
tried to form themselves into words but couldn&rsquo;t.
Mirth is contagious and the old woman laughingly
said: &ldquo;Tut! Tut! Jenny, don&rsquo;t keep all the fun of it
to yourself. What happened over to the seminary
that was so amusing? I reckoned you&rsquo;d have sort
of a hard tune making things straight with Miss
O&rsquo;Hara, if she&rsquo;s as snappy as poor Etta Heldt said
she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny became serious at once, and, leaning forward,
she began earnestly: &ldquo;Miss O&rsquo;Hara is kindhearted,
Granny Sue, but she does seem to have a
powerful lot to worry her. Etta didn&rsquo;t try to be real
helpful, I know that, although I was so sorry for
her, and when I told Miss O&rsquo;Hara all about the poor
orphan, there were tears in her eyes, honestly there
were, Granny, and she said that when the next
orphan came, she&rsquo;d try to make that kitchen more
homelike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her listener was pleased and nodded many times,
as she commented: &ldquo;Well, well, that&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; now
that my Jenny gal has brought to pass, but it wasn&rsquo;t
about that you were having such a spell of laughin&rsquo;,
I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there were twinkles in the brown eyes as
the girl confessed: &ldquo;No, Granny Sue, it wasn&rsquo;t, and
in as many years as Rip Van Winkle slept, you
couldn&rsquo;t guess what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The old woman looked puzzled, as she always did
when Jenny quoted from some of her &ldquo;readin&rsquo;
books.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wall, I reckon I couldn&rsquo;t, bein&rsquo; as I don&rsquo;t
know how long the lazy fellow slept, so I reckon
you&rsquo;d better tell me what you&rsquo;ve been up to over to
the seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had replaced her glasses and was again sewing
a patch on an old shirt of Grandpa Si&rsquo;s, but she
looked up when the girl said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be astonished
as can be, because you never even guessed that your
granddaughter knew how to wait on table, stylish-like,
with all the flourishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down went the sewing, up went the glasses, and
an expression of shocked displeasure was in the
sweet blue eyes of the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny Warner, am I hearin&rsquo; right? Are yo&rsquo;
tellin&rsquo; me that my gal waited on table over to the
seminary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked puzzled. Grandma Sue was taking
almost tragically what Jenny had considered in the
light of a merry adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Granny, I did. You don&rsquo;t mind, do
you? You have always wanted me to help where
help was needed, and surely poor Miss O&rsquo;Hara
needed a waitress. If we hadn&rsquo;t spirited Etta away,
she would have been there. You see, don&rsquo;t you,
Grandma, that I just had to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I reckon like as not you did, but don&rsquo;t
do it again, Jenny, don&rsquo;t! Promise, just to please
your old Grandma Sue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The girl placed her hat on the bench and went to
her grandmother&rsquo;s side and knelt, her head nestled
lovingly against the old woman&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Why,
Granny, dearie,&rdquo; she said contritely, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose
you&rsquo;d mind. Why is it that you do?&rdquo; She
was plainly perplexed.</p>
<p>But the old woman had no intention of telling the
girl she so loved that she could not bear the thought
of having her act as a servant to her own sister,
Gwynette. And so she replied with an assumed
cheeriness: &ldquo;Just a notion, dearie, like as not. I
feel that our gal is as good, and heaps better&rsquo;n a lot
of them seminary pupils, and I guess I sort of don&rsquo;t
like the idea of you waitin&rsquo; on &rsquo;em.&rdquo; Then anxiously:
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again, will it, Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl kissed her grandmother lovingly. Then
rising, she put her hat on her sun-glinted head as she
replied: &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be necessary, because Peg, the
real waitress, will be well again tomorrow. She had
one of her blind headaches today, but I did promise
to go over Monday after school and do Etta&rsquo;s work,
preparing vegetables. You don&rsquo;t mind that, do you,
Granny dear. The new orphan will be there by
Tuesday surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you do whatever you think right.
That heart o&rsquo; yourn won&rsquo;t take you far wrong.
You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; over to your school-teacher&rsquo;s now,
aren&rsquo;t you, dearie? She&rsquo;ll be expectin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The girl nodded, skipped into the house to get a
book, returned, saying as she went down the path:
&ldquo;This is our mythology lesson day. Good-bye,
Granny dear. I&rsquo;ll be home in time to get supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jenny drove Dobbin along the coast highway,
she wondered why her grandmother had objected so
seriously to the act of kindness that she had done.
Her teacher, Miss Dearborn, had so often said:
&ldquo;Jeanette, it isn&rsquo;t what we do that counts, it is what
we are.&rdquo; Surely Jenny had been no different from
what she really was when she had been filling cups
with steaming golden brown chocolate. Moreover,
Granny Sue hadn&rsquo;t minded in the least that time,
last year, when Jenny had gone over to the cabin
home of the poor forlorn squatter family in the
sycamore woods and had cleaned it out thoroughly.</p>
<p>She had found the mother sick in bed and the
three children almost spoiling for a bath. Jenny
smiled as she recalled how she had taken them, one
after another, down to the creek in the canon below
the cabin, and had washed them, showing the oldest,
Rosa, who was eight, how to give future baths to
Sara, aged five, and Elmer, aged two. And after
that she had driven, at Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s suggestion,
into Santa Barbara to tell the Visiting Nurse&rsquo;s
Association about the poor squatter family. Grandma
Sue had been pleased, then, to have Jenny serve
others. Why did she object to a similar service for
Miss O&rsquo;Hara? This being unanswerable, the girl
decided to drive through the Sycamore Canon Road,
as it was really but a little out of her way, and see
how the squatter&rsquo;s family was progressing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>It became very cool as she turned out of the sunshine
of the broad highway, and the deeper she drove
into the canon, the damper and more earth fragrant
the air. Great old sycamore trees that had grown in
most picturesque angles were on either side of the
narrow dirt road, and crossing and recrossing, under
little rustic bridges, rambled the brook which in
the spring time danced along as though it also were
brimming over with the joy of living. The cabin in
which the Pascoli family lived had been long abandoned
when they had taken possession. It stood in
a more open spot, where, for a few hours each day,
the sunlight came. It was partly adobe (from which
its former white-washed crust had broken away in
slabs) and partly logs. A rose vine, which Jenny
had given to the older girl, was bravely trying to
climb up about the door, and along the front of the
cabin were ferns transplanted from the brookside.</p>
<p>When Jenny hallooed, there was a joyful answering
cry from within, and three children, far cleaner
than when they had first been found, raced out, their
truly beautiful Italian faces beaming their pleasure.
They climbed up on the sides of the wagon shouting,
in child-like fashion, &ldquo;O, Miss Jenny, did you fetch
us any honey?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, dearies. I didn&rsquo;t! And I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve
eaten all that I brought you last week, have they,
Mrs. Pascoli?&rdquo; the girl looked over Sara&rsquo;s head to
the dark-eyed woman who appeared in the open door
carrying a wee baby wrapped in a shawl. She replied:
&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am! The beggars they are!&rdquo; Then
came a rebuking flow of Italian which had the effect
desired, for the three youngsters climbed down and
said in a subdued chorus, &ldquo;No&rsquo;m, we ain&rsquo;t et it, and
thanks for it till it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; the latter part of the
sentence being added by Sara alone. Jenny smiled
at them, then said to the woman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite well again, Mrs. Pascoli. I&rsquo;m so
glad! Grandpa tells me that your husband is working
steadily now. Next week I&rsquo;ll bring some more
honey and eggs. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl soon turned out of the canon on to a foothill
road and after a short climb came suddenly upon
a low built white house that had a wonderful view of
the ocean and islands.</p>
<p>She turned in at the drive, the gate posts of which
were pepper trees, and at once she saw her beloved
teacher, Miss Dearborn, working in her garden.</p>
<p>The woman, who was about thirty-five, looked up
with a welcoming smile which she reserved for this
her only pupil. &ldquo;Jenny Warner, you&rsquo;re an hour
late,&rdquo; she merrily rebuked. &ldquo;Hitch Dobbin and
come in. I have some news to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O, Miss Dearborn, is it good news? I&rsquo;m always
so dreading the bad news that, some day, I just
know you are going to tell me. It isn&rsquo;t that, yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman, whose strong, kind, intelligent face
was shaded with a wide-brimmed garden hat, smiled
at the girl, then more seriously she said: &ldquo;Shall you
mind so very much when the call comes for me to go
back East?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny nodded, unexpected tears in her eyes. &ldquo;East
is so far, so very far away, and you&rsquo;ve been here
for&mdash;well&mdash;for as many years as I have been going
to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten, to be exact,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t
my news today. It is something about you, and
you&rsquo;ll be ever so excited when you hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dearborn led the way into a long, cool living
room which extended entirely across the front of the
house. In one end of it was a large stone fireplace,
on either side of which were glassed-in book shelves.
There were Navajo rugs on the hardwood floor, a
piano at the opposite end, deep, cozily cushioned
seats under the wide plate-glass windows that framed
such wonderful views of sea, rocky promontory and
islands, mist-hung.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>In the middle was a long library table and everywhere
were chairs inviting ease. Great bowls of
glowing yellow poppies stood in many places about
the long room. This had been Jenny Warner&rsquo;s
second home, and Miss Dearborn a most beneficial
influence in her development.</p>
<p>Having removed her garden hat, a mass of soft,
light brown hair was revealed. Seating herself at
one end of the table, the older woman motioned the
girl to a chair at her side.</p>
<p>For a long moment she looked at her earnestly.
&ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I believe you are old
enough to be told something about me, but since it
is not nearly as important as the something about
you, I will begin with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, not in the least understanding why, felt
strangely excited. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn, if only it
hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with your going back East.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>A strong white hand was placed over the smaller
one that was lying on the table, and for a searching
moment the gray eyes met the brown. &ldquo;I believe,
after all, I will have to tell you the part about myself
first in order that you may more clearly understand
the part about you,&rdquo; Miss Dearborn said. &ldquo;I never
told you why I came West ten years ago. It was
this way. When I was fifteen, I went to a boarding
school in Boston and met there a girl, Beatrice Malcolm,
who became, through the four years that followed,
as dear to me as an own sister would have
been. She was not strong and she never had been
able to bear disappointment. I always gave in to
her and tried to shield her whenever I could. She
clung to me, depended on me and loved me, if not
quite as devotedly as I loved her, at least very dearly.
When we left boarding school we visited each other
for weeks at a time. She came to my Cape Cod
home in the summer, and I went to her New York
home in the winter, and so we shared the same
friends and were glad to do so, until Eric Austin
came into our lives. Eric and I were unusually companionable.
He loved books and nature and especially
the sea. He had come to Cape Cod to write a
group of poems and I met him at our Literary Club.
He came often to my home and we read together
day after day. Then Beatrice came for her annual
summer visit, and, after that there were three of us
at the readings. Eric&rsquo;s voice was deep, musical and
stirringly expressive. I began to notice that Beatrice
hung on every word that he uttered as though he
were a young god. There was something poetically
beautiful about his fine face. Then, one day, she
confessed to me that if she could not win Eric Austin&rsquo;s
love, she would not care to live. This was
cruelly hard for me, because I also loved Eric and
he had told me that my love was returned. Indeed,
I had not allowed myself to really care, until I knew
that he cared, but I had told him that I wanted to
wait until we had known each other at least through
one summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Miss Dearborn paused and gazed out of the window
at the blue sea shimmering in the distance, then
turned and smiled into the sensitive, responsive face
of the girl at her side. Almost tearfully, Jenny
said: &ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn, I know what you did.
You gave up the man you loved for that selfish girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head. &ldquo;Not selfish! Just
spoiled, and I had helped, for I had always given up
to her, and that is what I did. I pretended not to
care. I left them much alone, and then, when the
summer was over, I closed my Cape Cod home and
came West. Eric was deeply hurt, and wrote me
that, although he never could care for anyone as he
did for me, he was going to marry Beatrice and
would try to make her as happy as he had hoped to
make me. That was all. They were married while
I was settling in this new home. Year after year
Beatrice has written that some day she wants me to
come and visit them, and she has named her oldest
girl after me. Little Catherine is now eight. That
is all about me. Now I will tell the something about
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, deeply affected by what she had heard,
said with a little half sob: &ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn, it
makes my heart ache to think that you have lived all
these years so alone when you might have had the
companionship of that man who really loved you.
I just know he never could have loved your friend
Beatrice. She must have known you cared and she
let you make that cruel sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Before answering the older woman took the girl&rsquo;s
hand and held it in a close clasp as she said earnestly:
&ldquo;Jenny, dear, I gave up much, very much, but think
what I won. You, for instance. I had thought that
I might have a daughter, as I suppose all girls, growing
into young womanhood, dream that, some day,
they will marry and have children, and that daughter,
I now believe, would have been like you. So you
see I gained something very precious.&rdquo; There were
tears in Jenny&rsquo;s tender brown eyes as she replied:
&ldquo;Oh. Miss Dearborn, I am the one who has gained.
I just can&rsquo;t picture life without you. I remember so
well when you first came. You heard that our little
schoolhouse down on the coast highway was to be
closed because the board of education was not
allowed to pay a teacher&rsquo;s salary unless there were
eight pupils to attend the school. There were only
five of us, the four from the Anderson Bean Ranch
and me. You offered to teach us for nothing, saying
that you wanted to do something for children. I
didn&rsquo;t know that until long afterwards, then Grandma
told me how it had all come about. We were too
little to go on the bus to the big schools in Santa
Barbara.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad indeed that I did it,&rdquo; Miss Dearborn
put in, &ldquo;but, of course, when the Andersons moved
back to their Iowa farm and you were the only pupil
we closed that coast highway school and had our
lessons here, and such an inspiration as they have
been to me, Jenny Warner! I just know that you
are leading up to an expression of gratitude. I&rsquo;ve
heard it time and again and I do appreciate it, dear
girl, but now that you know the great loneliness that
was in my heart when I came West, you will readily
understand that having you to teach filled a void,
filled it beautifully, and so, I also have a deep sense
of gratitude toward you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two years ago,&rdquo; Jenny continued retrospectively,
&ldquo;when we completed the work of the sixth
grade, you can&rsquo;t think how unhappy I was, for I supposed
that at last I would have to leave you and go
by bus each day to the Santa Barbara Junior High,
and I never shall forget that wonderful day when
you told me you had received permission to teach
me through the eighth grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dearborn laughed happily. &ldquo;What I never
told you, Jenny, was that the board of education
insisted that I take an examination at their State
Normal to prove to them that I knew enough to
teach one lone pupil the higher grade work. I
brushed up evenings and passed creditably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively the girl pressed the woman&rsquo;s hand to
her cheek. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn,&rdquo; she exclaimed
tremulously, &ldquo;to <i>think</i> that you did <i>all</i> that <i>just</i> for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong you are, Jenny girl!&rdquo; the woman sang
out. &ldquo;I did it first of all for Catherine Dearborn.
I felt a panic in my heart I had not dreamed possible
when I thought that I was to be left all alone, day in
and day out, with only memory for company. I
wanted to keep you, to teach you, to love you, and
I did keep you, but now along comes a letter from
the same board of education. If we thought they
had forgotten us, we are mistaken. That&rsquo;s my news
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening a small drawer in the end of the table,
Miss Dearborn took out a letter and read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Jenny Warner will be required to take the
entrance examination in all the subjects at the High
School of Santa Barbara during the week of June
10th. The results of these tests will determine where
she is to continue her studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s lovely face was the picture of dismay.
&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn, I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;d be simply
frightened to death to even enter the door of that
imposing building, and if any of the pupils as much
as spoke to me, I&rsquo;d simply expire.&rdquo; Her teacher
laughed. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Not only
must my pupil enter the door but she must pass the
tests with high grades if I am to be permitted to
teach her another year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to change the girl&rsquo;s thought, Miss Dearborn
continued brightly: &ldquo;Saturday is our mythology
day, isn&rsquo;t it? But since you came late and we have
spent so much time visiting, we will not go up into
the hills as we usually do for this lesson. Let me
see. Weren&rsquo;t you to write something about Apollo,
Diana and Echo that I might know if you fully
understand just what each stands for in poetry and
art?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn,&rdquo; Jenny laughed as she
drew a paper from her book, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
you will say about the composition I tried to write.
It isn&rsquo;t good, I know, but I ever so much wanted to
write it in verse. Shall you mind my trying?&rdquo; The
girl&rsquo;s manner was inquiring and apologetic at the
same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; was the encouraging reply. &ldquo;We
all reach an age when we want to write our thoughts
in rhyme. Read it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so timidly Jenny began:</p>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="sc">At Sunrise</span></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Gray mists veil the dawn of day,</p>
<p class="t0">Silver winged they speed away,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When across a road of gold</p>
<p class="t0">In his shining chariot rolled</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Young Apollo. Day&rsquo;s fair King</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Robin, skylark, linnet, thrush</p>
<p class="t0">From each glen and flower-glad bush</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Burst their throats with warbles gay</p>
<p class="t0">To welcome back the King of Day.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Diana, huntress, Apollo&rsquo;s twin,</p>
<p class="t0">Standing in a forest dim,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">And so is dawned a glad new day.</p>
</div>
<p>Miss Dearborn smiled as she commented: &ldquo;Dear
girl, there is no need to blush about this, your first
effort at verse. I am going to suggest that you write
all of your compositions on this poetical subject in
rhyme. Keep them and let us see how much better
the last will be than the first.&rdquo; Then after a thoughtful
moment: &ldquo;Dawn is a subject much loved by
the poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she quoted from Byron:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The morn is up again, the dewy morn,</p>
<p class="t0">With breath all incense and with cheek all bloom;</p>
<p class="t0">Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn</p>
<p class="t0">(Living as if earth contained no tomb)</p>
<p class="t0">And glowing into day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn,&rdquo; was Jenny&rsquo;s enthusiastic
comment, &ldquo;how happy I will be when my memory
holds as many poems as you know. It will add to
the loveliness of every scene to know what some poet
has thought about one that was similar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, dear, it does.&rdquo; Then rising, Miss
Dearborn said: &ldquo;Come with me to the porch dining
room. I hear the kettle calling us to afternoon tea.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">AN ADVENTURE FILLED DAY</span></h2>
<p>It was late afternoon when Jenny returned from
Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s home high in the foothills. As she
drove up the long lane leading to the farmhouse, she
saw three young ladies from Granger Place Seminary
on horseback cantering along the highway
toward the mansion-like home of Mrs. Poindexter-Jones.
She was too far away, however, to be sure
that among them was the girl whom she believed to
be the daughter of the rich woman who owned the
farm.</p>
<p>Going to the barn, Jenny unhitched Dobbin, patting
him lovingly and chatting in a most intimate
friendly manner as though she were sure that he
understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a red letter day, haven&rsquo;t we, Dob?
First, early this morning we drove that poor Etta
Heldt to the station and loaned her money to help
her buy a ticket to Belgium.&rdquo; Then, in silent meditation,
the girl thought: &ldquo;How I wish I had a magic
carpet like that of The Little Lame Prince. I would
love to be over on that quaint Belgian farm when the
old people first see their granddaughter arriving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as she led the faithful horse out to the watering
trough under a blossoming peach tree, another
thought presented itself. &ldquo;Dobbin.&rdquo; she again addressed
her companion, &ldquo;now that we have loaned
part of the honey and egg money, wouldn&rsquo;t it be
dreadful if Mrs. Poindexter-Jones should decide to
sell this farm?&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;Though I suppose
that hundred dollars wouldn&rsquo;t go very far toward
buying it.&rdquo; For a contemplative moment the girl
gazed across the meadow where a pale green of early
grain was beginning to show, and then at the picturesque
old adobe partly hidden by the blossoming
orchard. It was all the home she had ever known
and it was hard to even think of moving to another.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t climb over a stile till you get to it,&rdquo; Grandpa
Si had often told her. Remembering this, she turned
her attention to her companion, who had lifted his
dripping head. &ldquo;My, but you were thirsty, weren&rsquo;t
you, Dob? Come on now into your nice cool stall.
I&rsquo;m eager to tell Grandma about that dreadful
examination I am to take.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Later, as she walked along the path which led past
the rows of beehives where there was ever a cheerful
humming, through the orchard and to the side porch,
her thoughts were varied. &ldquo;How I wish I could tell
Grandma Sue about Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s romance, but
<i>that</i> was meant just for me. Maybe it&rsquo;s wrong, but
I can&rsquo;t help wishing that something will happen
<i>some day</i> which will make it possible for that
romance to end happily, as stories always should,
whether they are real or in books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the corner of the porch she stopped to breathe
in the fragrance of the heliotrope blossoms that grew
on a riotous bush which seemed to be trying, vine-fashion,
to reach the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home again, after a day crowded full of unusual
happenings,&rdquo; her thoughts hummed along. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose that anything more <i>can</i> happen in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jenny Warner was mistaken, for something
of vital importance to her (though she little guessed
it) was yet to happen on that day.</p>
<p>Skipping into the kitchen, the girl beheld her
grandmother busy at the ironing board. Self rebukingly
she cried: &ldquo;Oh, Grandma Sue, why did
you iron today? You promised me faithfully, since
I had to go over to the seminary, and then to my
teacher&rsquo;s, that you wouldn&rsquo;t iron until next week,
when I could help. Now you look all hot and tired,
and as thirsty as Dobbin was. Please stop and rest
while I make us some lemonade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>The flushed face of the old woman was smiling
contentedly as she protested: &ldquo;I like to iron, dearie.
I&rsquo;m not doing much, just pressin&rsquo; out our church-goin&rsquo;
things. Grandpa Si needed a fresh shirt and
I reckoned as how, mabbe, you&rsquo;d like to wear that
white muslin o&rsquo; yourn with the pink flowers on the
bands, so I fetched it out an&rsquo; washed it an&rsquo; ironed
it, an&rsquo; there &rsquo;tis, lookin&rsquo; as purty again this year as it
did when it was furst made. Shouldn&rsquo;t you think
so. Jenny?&rdquo; This a little anxiously&mdash;&ldquo;or do you
reckon we&rsquo;d better buy you a new Sunday dress for
this comin&rsquo; summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny whirled toward the clothes-horse where
hung the pink sprigged muslin which had been
&ldquo;church goin&rsquo;&rdquo; dress for the past three summers.
The hem had twice been let down, but, except that
the pink had somewhat faded, it was as pretty as it
ever had been. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a love of a dress.&rdquo; The girl
was sincere. &ldquo;I hope I never will have to give it up.
I&rsquo;ve been so happy in it, and then it matches that
sweet parasol Miss Dearborn gave me and the
wreath on my white leghorn hat. I&rsquo;m glad I may
begin wearing it tomorrow, Grandma Sue, and it
was mighty nice of you to iron it for me, but now,
as soon as we&rsquo;ve had our drink, I&rsquo;m going to iron
your Sunday go-to-meeting lavender dress. Please
say that I may. I&rsquo;ll do the ruffles just beautifully.
You will be so vain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut! dearie.&rdquo; Susan Warner sank down in
Grandpa&rsquo;s armed chair to wipe her warm face and
rest while her beloved Jenny made lemonade. &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t do to wear that dress to meetin&rsquo; if it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to make me vain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>How the girl laughed as she squeezed the juicy
lemons that grew on the big tree close to the back
porch. Nearly all the year round that tree was laden
with blossoms, green and ripe fruit at the same time.
&ldquo;The most obliging kind of tree,&rdquo; Jenny had often
said. &ldquo;It provides a perfume, delicious lemon pies
and a refreshing drink whenever its owners wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Granny Sue, if only we had ice to
clink in it as Miss Dearborn has we&rsquo;d think that we
were rich folks, but it&rsquo;s real nice as it is.&rdquo; The girl
drank her share with a relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was mighty good tastin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Susan Warner
commented. &ldquo;I wish your Grandpa could have a
drink of it. He&rsquo;s cultivatin&rsquo; close to the high hedge.
That&rsquo;s a hot place when the sun is beatin&rsquo; down the
way it has been all day. Couldn&rsquo;t you carry a little
pailful over to him, dearie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can and will, Mrs. Susan Warner,
if you will promise me one thing.&rdquo; The girl gazed
down into the smiling face of the old woman. &ldquo;I
have my suspicions that you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of
me so that you may iron the lavender dress. Is that
the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; was the smilingly given confession,
&ldquo;but if you&rsquo;ll let me iron that one while you&rsquo;re gone,
you can do Grandpa&rsquo;s best shirt when you come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Filling a quart pail with the lemonade, Jenny
snatched her garden hat from its nail by the door
and skipped away, although she had to walk more
carefully when the ploughed ground was reached.
&ldquo;It makes me think of Robert Burns, and how, in
far-away Scotland, his plough turned over the home
nest of a poor little old field mouse,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Oh, how glad, glad I am that Miss Dearborn is
teaching me to love poetry. I can just see that
tender-hearted young poet leaning over, ever so
sorry because he had destroyed the little creature&rsquo;s
home and telling it not to be frightened.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Wee, sleekit, cowrin&rsquo;, tim&rsquo;rous beastie,</p>
<p class="t0">O, what a panic&rsquo;s in thy breastie!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou needna start awa&rsquo; sae hasty</p>
<p class="t0">Wi&rsquo; bick&rsquo;ring brattle.</p>
<p class="t0">I wad be laith to rin and chase thee</p>
<p class="t0">Wi&rsquo; murd&rsquo;ring prattle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny gal, what air yo&rsquo; sayin&rsquo;, talkin&rsquo; to yourself
that a-way?&rdquo; The girl suddenly looked up, realizing
that she had neared the high hedge that separated
the farm from the mansion-like home and its
grounds. Laughing happily, she replied: &ldquo;What
you&rsquo;d call up to my old tricks, Granddad, reciting
poetry that Miss Dearborn has had me learn. See,
here is a pail brimming full of cool lemonade, if it
hasn&rsquo;t warmed while I crossed the field. I&rsquo;m sure
you must be as thirsty as Grandma and Dobbin and
I were.&rdquo; For answer the old man pushed his wide
brimmed straw hat to the back of his head, lifted the
pail to his lips and drank it all without stopping.
Then said gratefully: &ldquo;I reckon I kin keep on now
fer a spell longer. I was most petered out an&rsquo; I do
want to finish this field afore I quit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>The girl left at once, as she wished to hurry home
to help with the ironing. She followed the hedge,
as the walking was easier, but suddenly she paused
and her hand went to her heart. She had heard the
voices of girls talking on the other side of the evergreens
and what one of them was saying greatly
startled the listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed,&rdquo; a proud voice was saying, &ldquo;we
own about one hundred acres, Ma Mere, brother
Harold and I. Our property extends along the seacoast
to the highwater mark, then back across the
highway up into Laurel Canon, and includes the
farm just beyond the hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another voice commented, &ldquo;If your mother should
die, you and your brother would be very rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, fairly,&rdquo; this with a fine show of indifference.
&ldquo;But if I had my way, all of our country
property would be turned into money, then we could
live abroad ever after. Mother promised that when
she comes in July she will consider selling the farm
and the canon property at least. She would have
sold the farm two years ago had it not been for my
brother Harold. For some reason, which Ma Mere
and I cannot in the least understand, he pleaded to
have the farm kept. He even offered to take it as
part of his share, that and the canon acreage, and
let me have the home and estate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did your mother say to that?&rdquo; a third
voice inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too utterly ridiculous to consider, and that, since
she wishes to turn something into cash, if we are to
live abroad, she will sell one or the other, and, of
course, there will be a more ready market for the
farm. It&rsquo;s a most picturesque old place. That is,
from a distance. I have never really been there.
You see, we have practically lived away from our
country home ever since I was born. I have always
supposed that, because of our father&rsquo;s long lingering
illness here, Ma Mere has dreaded returning to stay,
so imagine my surprise when she wrote that we were
all three to spend this summer at the old place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, who had stood transfixed, listening, though
against her will, for she scorned eavesdropping,
started to run across the ploughed field, stumbling
and almost falling in her haste. Oh, what should
she do? Should she tell Grandma and Grandpa the
terrible possibility that, after all, Rocky Point Farm
might be sold, and that very summer? No! No!
She couldn&rsquo;t do that. Oh, if only she had not loaned
Etta Heldt part of the honey and egg money, and
yet, with a crushing sense of depression, Jenny
realized that it did not in the least matter about that
paltry sum. If Mrs. Poindexter-Jones wished to sell
part of her land, all that her grandfather had saved
or could procure would be no inducement to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>When the orchard was reached, she stood very
still for a moment, her hand again on her heart, as
though to quiet its anxious beating that was almost
a pain. &ldquo;Jenny Warner,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;you
<i>must</i> not let Grandma suspect that anything is wrong
because, perhaps, nothing really is. If Harold does
not want the farm sold, his mother may heed his
wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two moments later a smiling girl entered the
kitchen, hung her hat on its nail by the door as she
said, &ldquo;Well, Granny Sue, I was longer than I expected
to be and you have started on the shirt. Let
me have the iron. I&rsquo;ll promise not to scorch it, the
way I did that towel you let me iron when I was just
head above the ironing board. Do you remember
it? You were so sweet about it when I cried. I recall,
even now, how you comforted me by saying that
the two ends of the towel would make such nice wash
cloths, hemmed up, and that it was lucky the scorch
was in the middle of the towel because that would
make the wash cloths just the right size.&rdquo; The old
woman had relinquished the iron, and, sitting near
in Grandpa&rsquo;s armed chair, she smiled lovingly at the
girl, who continued: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way you&rsquo;ve
overlooked all the mistakes I ever made. I do wish
that every girl in all the world had a grandmother
like you.&rdquo; Jenny was purposely chattering to keep
from telling what was uppermost in her mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a proud, vain girl that Gwynette Poindexter-Jones
must be!&rdquo; Jenny&rsquo;s thoughts were very
different from her spoken words. &ldquo;How cold and
superior the tone of her voice when she informed
her friends that she had never visited the farm, but
that it looked very picturesque from a distance.&rdquo;
Jenny&rsquo;s cheeks flushed as she indignantly told herself
that she certainly hoped that the farm never
would be visited by&mdash;&mdash;. Her thought was interrupted
by her exclamation of dismay. &ldquo;Grandmother
Sue. <i>Here</i> they come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman rose hastily from the armed
wooden chair. &ldquo;Who, dearie? Who is it you see?&rdquo;
No wonder she asked, for the girl with the iron
safely upheld, that it might not scorch the shirt front,
was staring with a startled expression out of the
window toward the long lane.</p>
<p>Susan Warner had not seen the missionary&rsquo;s older
daughter in many years, and so she did not recognize
her as being the young lady in the lead mounted on
a nervous, high-stepping black horse. Following
were two other girls in fashionable riding habits on
small brown horses. But the old woman did not
need to be told who the visitor was, for at once she
knew. There was indeed a resemblance to her own
Jenny in the face and the very build of the girl in
the lead. However, a stranger who did not know the
relationship would think little of it because of the
difference in the expressions. One face indicated a
selfish, proud, haughty nature, the other was far
more sensitive, joyous and loving. Jenny was again
ironing when the old woman turned from the window
to ask, &ldquo;Do yo&rsquo; know who they be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Granny; the one ahead is Gwynette
Poindexter-Jones, and the two others are her best
friends, the ones who came to Granger Place with
her from San Francisco. You know I saw them all
close up this noon when I waited on table over at
the seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner had stepped out on the side porch
when the young lady in the lead drew rein. She
wanted to close the door, shutting Jenny in, but since
the door stood open from dawn until sunset each
day, she knew that such an act would arouse suspicion.
But <i>how</i> she did wish she could prevent
Jenny&rsquo;s meeting her very own sister and being
treated as an inferior.</p>
<p>The girl at the ironing board listened intently,
strainingly, that she might hear if the selling of the
farm was mentioned.</p>
<p>Gwynette was saying, &ldquo;My mother told me to
ride over to our farm some day and ask you to see
that the big house is put in readiness for occupancy
by the first of July. Ma Mere said that you could
hire day labor to have the cleaning done, but that
she prefers to engage our permanent servants
after she arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>How unlike her dear grandmother&rsquo;s voice was the
one that was coldly replying: &ldquo;I reckon your ma&rsquo;ll
write any orders she has for me. She allays does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Gwynette recognized a rebelliousness in the
remark and manner of the farmer&rsquo;s wife, she put it
down to ill-breeding and ignorance, and so said in
her grandest air, &ldquo;Kindly bring us each a drink of
milk.&rdquo; Then, turning to her friends, she added,
&ldquo;All of the produce of the farm is for our use, but
since we are seldom here, it is, of course, sold in the
village. I suppose Ma Mere receives the profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being unnecessarily rude?&rdquo; Beulah
Hollingsworth inquired. Gwynette shrugged. &ldquo;Oh,
nobody heard,&rdquo; she said in a tone which implied
that she would not have cared if they had. But she
was mistaken, for Jenny had heard and her cheeks
flamed with unaccustomed anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the bees yours also?&rdquo; Patricia Sullivan inquired,
glancing back at the orchard where a constant
humming told that swarms of tiny winged
creatures were gathering sweets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; was the languidly given reply.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take some of the honey back with us. These
people have to do as I say. They are just our servants.&rdquo;
To the amazement of the three, a flashing-eyed
girl darted out on the porch as she cried, &ldquo;You
shall <i>not</i> call my grandmother and my grandfather
your servants. And those bees <i>do not</i> belong to you.
I bought them, and the white hens, with my <i>very
own</i> Christmas and birthday money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Susan Warner, coming from the cooling cellar
with three goblets of milk, was amazed, for very
seldom had she seen a flash of temper in the sweet
brown eyes of her girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dearie, whatever &rsquo;twas they said,&rdquo;
she murmured in a low voice. &ldquo;Go back to your
ironin&rsquo;, Jenny; do, to please your ol&rsquo; granny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently the girl returned to the kitchen, but
she felt sure, from the fleeting glance she gave the
companions of Gwynette, that <i>they</i> were not in sympathy
with her rudeness.</p>
<p>After drinking the milk, the three rode away, and
from the indignant tones of one of them the listeners
knew that the proud daughter of Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
had been angered by the attitude of her
mother&rsquo;s servants.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s heart was indeed heavy as she contemplated
the dreary possibility that her angry words
might hasten the day when her loved ones would
lose their home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Sadly she finished her task and put away the ironing
board. Then she recalled that an hour before
she had assured herself that nothing else of an unusual
nature was apt to happen in that day already
crowded with events, but she had been mistaken.
She had met Harold&rsquo;s sister and had quarreled with
her. Then, and for the first time, she realized that
she had half hoped that the daughter of their next
door neighbor and she might become friends. Jenny
had never had a close girl friend, and like all other
girls she had yearned for one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; her grandmother was making an evident
effort at cheeriness, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll be settin&rsquo; the
table, I&rsquo;ll start the pertatoes to fryin&rsquo;. Here comes
your grandpa. He looks all petered out, and he&rsquo;ll
want his supper early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny smiled her brightest as she began the task
of consoling herself with the thought that Harold
Poindexter-Jones was their true friend, and how
she did wish that she might see <i>him</i> and ask him if
the farm was to be sold.</p>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">AN OLD FRIEND APPEARS</span></h2>
<p>The next morning, while Jenny was standing in
front of her mirror in her sun-flooded bedroom nearest
the sea, she reviewed in memory the events of
the day previous. She found it hard to understand
her own anger or why it had flared so uncontrollably.
After all Grandpa Si <i>was</i> the farmer in Mrs. Poindexter-Jones&rsquo;
employ and, what was more, Grandma
Sue <i>had</i> been housekeeper over at the big house for
years before Jenny had been born, and there was no
disgrace in that. The girl challenged the thought
that had recalled this almost forgotten fact. Didn&rsquo;t
Miss Dearborn say that it is not your occupation but
what you are that really counts?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Determinedly she put from her the troubling
memory and centered her attention for the first time
on the reflection before her. She did indeed look
pretty in the ruffled white muslin with the pink sprig
embroidery, and tender brown eyes looked out from
under a wide white hat, pink wreathed. There was
no complaining thought in her heart because both
dress and hat were many summers old.</p>
<p>Opening a drawer in her old-fashioned bureau,
Jenny took out her prized pink silk parasol and
removed its soft paper wrappings.</p>
<p>A mocking bird just outside her open window
poured one joyous song after another into the peaceful
sunlit air. For a thoughtful moment the girl
gazed out at the shimmering blue sea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
I flared up at Harold&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; she said aloud. Then
hearing her grandmother calling from the side porch,
she sang out: &ldquo;Coming, Granny Sue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny could not have told why everything and
everyone revolved around Harold P-J. She thought
of the proud woman, whom she had once seen in the
long ago, as &ldquo;Harold&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; and of the girl
whom she had defied as &ldquo;Harold&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; yet she
had not seen the boy since that stormy day two years
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Skipping to the side porch, she found Grandma
Sue looking very sweet in her lavender muslin, and
tiny black bonnet with lavender ribbons, already up
on the wide seat of the buggy. Breaking a few
blossoms from the heliotrope at the corner of the
house, Jenny handed them up to her. &ldquo;Put them on,
somewhere,&rdquo; she called merrily, &ldquo;and I shall have
a cluster of pink Cecile Brunner roses for my belt.
Granddad, how dressed up you look in the shirt that
I ironed. Do you want a buttonhole bouquet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; the old man&rsquo;s horrified expression amused
the girl. Standing on tiptoe, she kissed his brown,
wrinkled cheek, then clambered up beside her grandmother.</p>
<p>Silas Warner climbed over the wheel and took up
the loose rein. Dobbin was indeed a remarkable
horse. He seemed to know that on Sunday he was
to turn toward the village, and yet he stopped after
having cantered about two miles and turned down a
pine-edged lane that led to St. Martin&rsquo;s-by-the-Sea.
It was the only church in all that part of the country,
and so was attended by rich and poor alike. The
seminary girls attended the service all together and
filled one side of the small church. Jenny, near the
aisle, close to the back, was kneeling in prayer when
a late arrival entered and knelt in front of her. It
was a young man dressed in a military school
uniform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Grandpa Si was the first to recognize the stranger
and he whispered to his companion: &ldquo;Ma ain&rsquo;t that
little Harry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Discreetly the good woman nodded, her eyes
never leaving the face of the preacher who was beginning
his sermon. Jenny&rsquo;s heart was in a flutter
of excitement. Surely it was her friend Harold
P-J, and yet, two years before he had been just a
boy. Now he was much taller with such broad
shoulders and how straight he stood when they
rose to sing a hymn. She had not seen his face as
she was directly behind him. Perhaps, after all,
she was mistaken, she thought, for she had plainly
heard his sister tell her friends that Harold was not
expected until the mother returned from France in
July and it was only the first week in May. But
she had not been wrong, as she discovered as soon
as the benediction had been said, for the young man
turned with such a pleased expression on his good
looking face, and, holding out his hand to the older
woman, he said with ringing sincerity in his voice.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great, Mrs. Warner, to see you looking so
well.&rdquo; Then, after giving a hearty handshake, and
receiving two from the farmer, the boy turned
smilingly toward Jenny. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t, you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be
that little, rubber-hooded girl whom I picked up two
years ago in the storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am though.&rdquo; Jenny&rsquo;s rose-tinted cheeks were
of a deeper hue, &ldquo;But you also have grown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Standing very straight and tall, the boy looked
down beamingly upon all three. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I have,&rdquo; he
agreed, &ldquo;but honestly I do hope I&rsquo;m not going up
any higher.&rdquo; Then after a quick glance across the
aisle, where the Granger Place Young Ladies were
filing out, he said hastily. &ldquo;Mrs. Warner, won&rsquo;t
you invite a stranded youth to take dinner with you
today? I&rsquo;ve got to see sister this afternoon, and
return to the big city tonight, but I&rsquo;m pining to
have a real visit with you.&rdquo; Then to Jenny, by way
of explanation. &ldquo;Perhaps you never heard about
it, but your Grandma Sue took care of me the first
three years of my life and so I shall always consider
her a grandmother of mine.&rdquo; Susan Warner&rsquo;s
mind had flown hastily back to the home
larder. What did she have cooked that was fine
enough for company. But the youth seemed to
understand. &ldquo;Just anything that you have ready
is what I want. No fuss and feathers, remember
that. I&rsquo;ll be there in one hour. Will that be time
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandpa Si spoke up heartily. &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ll
find a dinner waitin&rsquo; whenever you get there, Harry-boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Gwynette received her brother with a sneering
curve to her mouth that might have been pretty.
&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you know that everyone in the church
was watching you and criticizing you for making
such a fuss over our mother&rsquo;s servants,&rdquo; was her
ungracious greeting. A dull red appeared in the
boy&rsquo;s cheeks, but he checked the angry words before
they were uttered. Instead he said: &ldquo;Gwynette,
may I call at the seminary this afternoon? I
have had a letter from Mother and I want to talk
it over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon?&rdquo; a rising inflection of inquiry.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to take me to The Palms to
dine? I&rsquo;m just starved for a real course dinner
and the minute I saw you I made up my mind that
was what we would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy hesitated. His conscience rebuked him.
He knew that their mother would expect him to be
chivalrous to his sister. He also knew that a vision
in pink and white, a pair of appealing liquid brown
eyes had, for the moment caused him to forget his
duty. &ldquo;All right, sis,&rdquo; he said, trying not to let
the reluctance in his heart show in his voice. &ldquo;Ask
your chaperone if you may go with me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he was alone, Harold hurried around
the vine-covered church to the sheds where he hoped
to find the Warner family. They were just driving
out of the lane, but the old man drew rein when he
saw the lad hurrying toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, Mrs. Warner,&rdquo; he began with
a ring of sincerity in his voice, which carried conviction
to the listeners. &ldquo;Gwynette wants me to
take her to The Palms for dinner, and, of course,
<i>that</i> is what our mother would wish me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, wall, that&rsquo;s all right, Harry,&rdquo; Grandpa Si
put in consolingly. &ldquo;&rsquo;Taint as though you can&rsquo;t
come again. You&rsquo;re welcome over to the farm
whenever you&rsquo;re down this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s last glance was directed at the girl as
also was his parting remark. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to run
down from the city real soon. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny was truly disappointed as she had hoped
to have an opportunity to ask the lad if it were true
that his mother planned selling the farm during the
summer.</p>
<p>She consoled herself by recalling his promise to
come back soon. And then as Dobbin trotted briskly
homeward, the girl fell to dreaming of the various
things that might happen during the summer.</p>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">BROTHER AND SISTER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Palms,&rdquo; architecturally a Mission Inn, was
gorgeously furnished and catered only to the ultra-rich.
It was located picturesquely on a cliff with
a circling palm-edged drive leading to it.</p>
<p>Santa Barbara was both a winter and summer
resort and its hostelries were famed the world over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Gwynette led her brother to the table of her choice
in the luxurious dining room, the windows of which,
crystal clear, overlooked the ocean. She was fretful
and pouting. Harold, after having drawn out
her chair, seated himself and looked almost pensively
at the shimmering blue expanse, so close to
them, just below the cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t paying the least bit of attention to
me,&rdquo; Gwynette complained. &ldquo;I just asked if you
weren&rsquo;t pining to be over in Paris this spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad turned and looked directly at the girl,
candor in his clear grey eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, sister, I do not wish anything of the
sort,&rdquo; he replied sincerely. &ldquo;What I <i>do</i> hope is
that our mother will be well enough to return to us,
and that the quiet of our country home will completely
restore her health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette shrugged her shoulders, but said nothing,
until their orders had been given; then she remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why our mother needs to rusticate
for three months in this stupid place. If <i>we</i> could
have a house party, of course, that would help to
make it endurable for <i>me</i>, but in her last letter Ma
Mere distinctly said that we were to invite no one,
as her nerves were in need of absolute quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, who had folded his arms looked at his
sister penetratingly, almost critically. Suddenly he
blurted out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Gwynette, sometimes I think you
do not care, really care, deep in your heart for our
mother as much as I do. In fact, I sometimes wonder
if you care for anyone except yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>The girl flushed angrily. &ldquo;Your dinner conversation
is most ungracious, I am sure,&rdquo; she flung at
him, but paused and looked at a young man also in
uniform, who was hurrying toward their table with
an undeniably pleased expression on his tanned face.
Harold rose and held out his hand, glad of any interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tod, where did you drop from?&rdquo; Then
to the girl he said: &ldquo;Sister Gwynette, this is a chap
from the same San Francisco prison in which I am
incarcerated&mdash;Lieutenant James Creery by name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl held up a slim, white hand over which
the youth bent with an ardor which had won for
him the heart of many a young lady in the past and
probably would in the future, but in the present he
was welcomed as a much-needed diversion from a
most upsetting family quarrel. Having accepted
their invitation to make a third at the small table,
apart from the others, the young man seated himself,
saying to the girl: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me interrupt any confidences
you two were having. I know you don&rsquo;t
see each other often, since we poor chaps have but
one free Sunday a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette smiled her prettiest and even her
brother conceded that if Gwyn would only take the
trouble to smile now and then she might be called
handsome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our conversation was neither deep nor interesting
to anyone but me. I was wishing that we were
to spend the summer&mdash;well, anywhere rather than
in our country home four miles out of this stupid
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid?&rdquo; the young man, nicknamed Tod,
glanced about at the charmingly gowned young
women at the small tables near them. &ldquo;This crowd
ought to keep things stirring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette shook her head. &ldquo;Nothing but weekend
guests motored up from Los Angeles or down
from San Francisco. From Monday to Friday the
place is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the inconsequential talk flowed on, until
at last James Creery excused himself, as he had an
engagement. Again bowing low over Gwynette&rsquo;s
hand, he departed. The smiling expression in the
girl&rsquo;s eyes changed at once to a hard glint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you said that you came down especially to
talk over a letter from our mother. You might as
well tell me the worst and be done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad made no attempt to hide his displeasure.
&ldquo;There was no worst to it, Gwynette. I merely
hoped that you would wish to plan with me some
pleasant surprise as a welcome to our mother&rsquo;s
homecoming. I find that I was mistaken. Shall we
go now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The girl rose with an almost imperceptible fling
of defiance to her shapely head. &ldquo;As you prefer,&rdquo;
she said coldly. &ldquo;I really cannot say honestly that
I feel any great enthusiasm about we three settling
down in humdrum fashion in our country place,
but, if it is my duty, as you seem to infer, to <i>pretend</i>
that I am overjoyed, you may plan whatever
you wish and I will endeavor to <i>seem</i> enthusiastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were again in the small car before the lad
replied: &ldquo;Do not feel that it is incumbent on you
in any way to co-operate with me in welcoming <i>my</i>
mother.&rdquo; There was an emphasis on the my which
did not escape the notice of the girl, and it but
increased her anger. She was convinced that her
brother meant it as an implied rebuke, and she was
right.</p>
<p>Gwynette bit her lips and turned away to hide
tears of self pity. When the seminary was reached,
the lad assisted the haughty girl from the car with
his never-failing courtesy, accompanied her to the
door, ventured a conciliating remark at parting, but
was not even rewarded with a glance.</p>
<p>Harold was unusually thoughtful as he rode along
the highway. He passed the gate to the lane leading
to the farm, assuring himself that he was in no mood
for visiting even with friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">VIEWS AND REVIEWS</span></h2>
<p>Monday morning dawned gloriously, but it was
with great effort that Jenny made her mood match
the day. Often her grandparents glanced at her
and then at one another as they ate their simple
breakfast. At last her grandfather asked: &ldquo;What
be yo&rsquo; studyin&rsquo; on so hard, dearie? Is it anything
about yo&rsquo;re schoolin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s frettin&rsquo; you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, who had been gazing at the bowl of
golden poppies on the middle of the table with unconscious
abstraction, looked up with a bright
smile. Luckily her grandfather&rsquo;s remark gave her a
suggestion to enlarge upon. Turning to the little old
woman whose sweet blue eyes were watchfully inquiring,
the girl said: &ldquo;Something has happened,
or rather it is going to happen.&rdquo; She paused a moment,
but her grandfather urged: &ldquo;Do go on,
Jenny. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s stop for no guessin&rsquo; contest this
time. I&rsquo;ve got to get out early to the cultivatin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny told how the Board of Education had required
Miss Dearborn to take a teacher&rsquo;s examination
before she had been permitted to continue instructing
her one lone pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut! Wall now, yo&rsquo; don&rsquo; tell?&rdquo; Grandma
Sue was much impressed. &ldquo;Did Miss Dearborn
go an&rsquo; take them teachin&rsquo; examinations jest so she
could keep on helpin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; wi&rsquo; your studies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. &ldquo;She must set a power by you,&rdquo;
the old woman concluded. Grandpa Si spoke up.
&ldquo;Huh, how could she help it? I reckon every critter
as knows Jenny sets a power by her, but thar
must be more to the yarn. I don&rsquo; see anything, so
far, for you to fret about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is more,&rdquo; Jenny agreed, &ldquo;Miss Dearborn
has had a letter from the Board of Education
saying that I must take the high school examinations
next month. Think of it, Granny Sue! I&rsquo;ve got
to go to that big new high school over in Santa
Barbara where I don&rsquo;t know a single soul, and take
written examinations, when I never have had even
one in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the grandfather&rsquo;s faith in his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; was
expressed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>my</i> notion when them examinations
are tuk, <i>your&rsquo;s</i> &rsquo;ll be leadin&rsquo; all the rest. Thar
ain&rsquo;t many gals as sober minded as <i>yo&rsquo;</i> be, Jenny,
not by a long ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s merry laughter pealed out and the
twinkle in her liquid brown eyes did not suggest
sober-mindedness. Rising she skipped around the
table kissing affectionately her grandfather&rsquo;s bald
spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping that you won&rsquo;t be disappointed
in your granddaughter. But really she isn&rsquo;t half
as wise as you think she is.&rdquo; Then turning toward
the smiling old woman, she concluded, &ldquo;Is she, Mrs.
Susan Warner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sweet blue eyes told much more than the
reply. &ldquo;Wall, I reckon yo&rsquo; won&rsquo;t come out tail-end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the girl laughed, then donning her hat and
taking her books, she merrily called &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
But her expression changed when she reached the
lane and started walking briskly toward the highway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>The real cause of her anxiety returned to trouble
her thoughts. &ldquo;Oh, I <i>must</i> study so hard, so hard,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;Then I will be able to be a teacher
and make a home for my dear old grandparents.
How I hope the farm will not be sold until then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny did not follow the highway, but took a
short cut trail to Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s hillside home. It
led over a rugged upland where gnarled live oaks
twisted their rough barked branches into fantastic
shapes. Jenny loved low-growing oaks and she
never climbed through this particular grove of them,
however occupied her thoughts might be as they
were on this troubled morning, without giving them
a greeting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that Miss Dearborn is teaching
me mythology, for otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t know
that each of these trees is really the home of a dryad,
beautiful, slender graceful sprites, born when the
tree is born and dying when the tree dies. How I
would love to come here some moon-lit night in the
spring and watch them dance to the piping of Pan.
They would have wide fluttering sleeves in their garments
woven of mist and moonbeams and they would
be crowned with oak leaves, but how sad it would be
if a woodchopper came and chopped down one of
the trees, for that night there would be one less
dryad at the dance on the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Beyond the trees there was a long sweep of
meadowland down the hill side to the highway, and
beyond to the rocky edge of the sea. On this bright,
spring morning it was a glittering, gleaming carpet
of waving poppy cups of gold.</p>
<p>Joyfully the girl cried, pausing on the edge of it,
&ldquo;O, I know the poem Miss Dearborn would quote.
I thought of it right away.&rdquo; Then she recited aloud,
though there was no one to hear.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I wandered lonely as a cloud</p>
<p class="t">That floats on high o&rsquo;er vales and hills,</p>
<p class="t0">When all at once I saw a crowd,</p>
<p class="t">A host of shining daffodils</p>
<p class="t0">Beside the lake, beneath the trees</p>
<p class="t0">Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Continuous as the stars that shine,</p>
<p class="t">And twinkle on the milky way,</p>
<p class="t0">They stretched in never ending line,</p>

<p class="t0">Ten thousand saw I at a glance</p>
<p class="t0">Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The waves beside them danced, but they</p>
<p class="t">Outdid the sparkling waves in glee.</p>
<p class="t0">A poet could not but be gay</p>
<p class="t">In such a jocund company.</p>
<p class="t0">I gazed and gazed, but little thought</p>
<p class="t0">What wealth to me the show had brought.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For oft when on my couch I lie</p>
<p class="t">In vacant or in pensive mood,</p>
<p class="t0">They flash upon that inward eye</p>
<p class="t">Which is the bliss of solitude.</p>
<p class="t0">And then my heart with rapture fills</p>
<p class="t0">And dances with the daffodils.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only Wordsworth had lived in California,&rdquo;
she thought as she continued on her way, &ldquo;he would
have written just such a poem about these fields of
golden poppies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the girl, feeling an inward
glow from so close a communion with Nature, the
greatest of artist-poets, skipped between the two
graceful pepper trees that were the gate posts of
Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s attractive hillside home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dearie, how bright you are this morning,&rdquo;
was the greeting the woman, digging about in her
garden, sang out. Then, standing her hoe against
a rustic bench, she began taking off her gloves, as
together they walked toward the house. &ldquo;I am indeed
glad,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;for you are to have a
hard testing today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the morning glow faded from the girl&rsquo;s
face and a troubled expression clouded her eyes.
&ldquo;Miss Dearborn, what now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>The older woman laughed. &ldquo;No need of high
tragedy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that I have paid a
visit to the principal of the high school, and have
obtained from him the questions used on examinations
for several years past, and today I am going
to give you your first written test. We have nearly
a month for review, and each week I shall ask you
one complete set of questions of previous years and
then, at least, you will be familiar with written
examinations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dearborn, how kind, how wonderfully
kind you are to me. It would be most ungrateful
of me to fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fail? There is no such word for the earnest
student who has worked faithfully day by day all
through the term as my pupil has. There will be no
need of that nerve-racking system called cramming
for you.&rdquo; Then, as they ascended the steps to the
wide veranda, Miss Dearborn exclaimed, &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;ve
put a table in the glassed-in corner. I&rsquo;m going to
shut you in there until noon with the questions,
and I shall expect your average to be 90 at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny felt a little thrill of excitement course over
her, and she started at her new task with a determination
to try her best to be worthy of the faith
placed in her by the three who loved her so dearly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">PLOTS AND PLAYS</span></h2>
<p>Meanwhile a very different scene was being
enacted in the Granger Place Seminary.</p>
<p>Gwynette Poindexter-Jones occupied the largest
and most attractively furnished room on the second
floor of the dormitory building, and her two best
friends shared the one adjoining. There was a bath
between with doors opening upon a narrow private
corridor.</p>
<p>Gwynette had not liked the room when she first
arrived, as it was, she declared, too &ldquo;barnlike&rdquo; in
its barrenness. Miss Granger regretted this, as she
assured the daughter of her richest patron, but
she really could not furnish the rooms to please
the young ladies, and there was no other apartment
available at that late period of the term.</p>
<p>The haughty Gwynette had then requested that
the furniture in the room be removed. After this
had been done, she brought from her mother&rsquo;s home
by the sea handsome mahogany pieces upholstered in
rich blue. There were portieres and window hangings
to match and priceless pictures adorned the
walls. The furnishing in the room of her friends
had remained unchanged and was far more appropriate,
in that it suggested studiousness rather than
indolence and luxury.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Gwynette, in a velvet dressing robe of the same
rich blue embroidered with gold in chrysanthemum
design, was lying at full length on a many-cushioned
lounge, a blue and gold slipper dangling from the
toe of one foot. She was reading a forbidden novel,
and eating chocolate creams, when there came a soft
tap on the door leading into the main corridor.
Gwynette always kept it locked that she need not be
surprised by the appearance of Madam Vandeheuton,
monitor of the dormitory, or by one of the
infrequent visits of Miss Granger herself. Sitting
erect, the girl&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she pondered.</p>
<p>Should she keep very still and pretend that she
was out, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Her thought was interrupted by a low voice calling:
&ldquo;Gwyn, let us in, can&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; Languidly the
girl rose and, after unlocking the door, she inquired
of the two who entered: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea? You
know the door between our rooms is always unlocked.
Couldn&rsquo;t you come in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah Hollingsworth reached down to the little
blue velvet stool near the couch and helped herself
to a chocolate. &ldquo;Of course we could have come the
usual way, only we were passing through the corridor
and so this door was nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t do it again. I implore.&rdquo; Gwynette
once more stretched at full length and ease as she
remarked indolently, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier for you to go
around than for me to get up. Well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>She looked inquiringly at Patricia Sullivan. &ldquo;Did
you call on the sphynx and get at her secret? Sit
down, do! It makes me tired to see you standing
so stiffly as though you had ramrods for backbones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the girls sat down, one on a Louis XVI
chair and the other on one of recent and more comfortable
design. Beulah began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we called and found Clare Tasselwood as
uncommunicative as she was when we met her in
the garden and tried to draw her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am more than ever convinced that the
secretive Clare is the daughter of a younger son of
a noble English family. My theory is that she is
going to keep quiet about it until the older son dies,
and then those who befriended her when she was
unknown will be honored as her guests when she
takes her rightful place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I for one shall cultivate her. An invitation
to visit the castle home of Lord Tasselwood would
be most welcome to me. You girls may do as you
please about it.&rdquo; Gwynette was again in a sitting
posture and she glanced inquiringly at her companions.
They both declared that they wished to
be included. &ldquo;Then, firstly, we must obtain permission
to give a spread worthy of her presence, at The
Palms, no less, even if it costs our combined allowances
for a month.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Then they planned together what they would
wear and whom they would invite. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask my
brother to bring down as many cadets as we have
girls,&rdquo; was Gwyn&rsquo;s final decision.</p>
<p>When Clare Tasselwood received the gilt-edged
invitation, there was a little twist to one corner of
her month which was her way of smiling when she
was amused, and cynical. She had overheard a
conversation the day they had met in the garden.
&ldquo;The Lady Clara of Tasselwood Manor accepts
with pleasure,&rdquo; she told her reflection in the mirror.</p>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">FERNS AND FRIENDS</span></h2>
<p>True to her promise, Jenny Warner went to the
seminary on Monday, after her lessons were over,
to see if she could be of assistance to Miss O&rsquo;Hara.</p>
<p>The kindly Irish woman saw the girl coming and
met her at the open kitchen door with so beaming
a face that the newcomer was convinced that something
of a pleasant nature had occurred, nor was
she wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colleen, it&rsquo;s true blue you are, keepin&rsquo; your word
so handsome, but there&rsquo;s no need for you to be
stayin&rsquo;. Another of them orphans blew in along
about noon-time, and it did me heart good to set eyes
on the bright face of her. She went to work with
a will, not wishin&rsquo; to rest even. Her name&rsquo;s Nora
O&rsquo;Flynn, and her forebears came from the same part
of old Ireland which gave birth to mesilf. &rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t
be hard to be makin&rsquo; the kitchen homelike for <i>this</i>
orphan,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Jenny went away joyfully. Things had turned
out wonderfully for them all. Miss O&rsquo;Hara could
never have been happy with Etta Heldt, who was
of a race she could not understand, but now that she
was to have with her one of her own people, her
long days of drudgery would be lightened and
brightened.</p>
<p>As Jenny tripped down the box-bordered path
leading from the seminary to a canyon trail that
would be a short-cut to the farm, she passed the
tennis courts, where several games were in progress.
She glanced at the players, wondering if any
of them might be the haughty sister of Harold P-J.
But tennis was altogether too strenuous a pastime
for the ever indolent Gwynette.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>The back trail led along the Sycamore Canyon
creek, where ferns of many varieties were growing;
some were as tall as the girl who was passing them,
while, among the moss-covered rocks, close to the
brook, were the more feathery and delicate maiden
hair ferns. It had been very warm in the sun, but
there was a most welcome damp coolness in the
canyon. For a moment Jenny stood still at the top
of the trail gazing down, listening to the quietness,
broken only by the constant gurgling rush of the
water. Then she started walking slowly along the
trail, picking her way carefully, as it was rough
and rocky, and at places very narrow. It amused
her to note the different sounds of the brook. At
one spot there was a whirling little eddy, then a
sudden fall over a steep rock, then a hurried rushing
till a broad pool-like place was reached. There the
waters were deeper and quieter, as though pausing
for a moment&rsquo;s rest before taking a plunge of many
feet to the lower part of the canyon. Just above
the Maiden-hair Falls, a rustic bridge crossed from
one great boulder to another, and, as Jenny came in
sight of it, she stopped, amazed, for there, sitting
on one end of the bridge and leaning against the
bending trunk of a great old sycamore tree, was a
girl of her own age. Who could she be? Jenny
had not heard of anyone new moving into the
neighborhood. In fact, there were no houses in
the canyon except the one occupied by the Pascoli
family.</p>
<p>A small stone, disturbed by Jenny&rsquo;s foot, rattled
noisily down the trail, struck the bridge and bounded
away into the lower canyon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>The stranger glanced up with an expression that
was almost startled and Jenny saw that it was the
girl in brown whom she had twice noticed: once in
the yard of the seminary, when she had been left so
alone, and again in the dining hall when she had
passed a dish, almost shyly, to the grand appearing
Clare Tasselwood. Jenny remembered that this girl
had said &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and had smiled pleasantly
when her cup had been filled with chocolate. She
was smiling again, a bright welcoming smile, which
assured Jenny that the stranger wished to speak to
her, nor was she wrong, for, as soon as the bridge
was reached, the girl in brown exclaimed: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
this a wonderful place that I&rsquo;ve found? It&rsquo;s the first
time since I came to this school that I haven&rsquo;t been
depressingly lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s heart rejoiced. This girl must also love
nature if she could feel real companionship in an
almost silent canyon. Impulsively, she said, &ldquo;Shall
you mind if I sit here with you for a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind?&rdquo; The other girl&rsquo;s brown eyes gladdened.
&ldquo;I was hoping that you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny seated herself on the rustic bridge directly
over the rushing falls. &ldquo;Oh, hadn&rsquo;t you better move
over near this end?&rdquo; her companion asked anxiously.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the hurrying whirl of the water underneath
make you dizzy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny shook her head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re old friends,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;I am acquainted with Sycamore Canyon
brook from its very beginning way up in the
foothills, and it flows into the sea not far from
the farm where I live.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; Again the bright upward glance.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you live on a farm, for I do also, when
I&rsquo;m at home in Dakota. My father is a farmer. I
haven&rsquo;t told it before, fearing the seminary girls
might snub me if they knew. Not that I would
care much. All I ask of them is to let me alone, and
they certainly do that.&rdquo; Then in a burst of confidence,
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what to say to girls,
nor how to act with them. I have lived so many
years on an isolated farm and, would you believe
it, I never, actually never, had a flesh and blood girl
friend. I&rsquo;ve had steens and steens of book-character
friends, and I honestly believe, on the whole, I like
them best.&rdquo; Then with a shy side glance, &ldquo;Do you
think I am queer? Tell me so truly if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny moved closer to the girl in brown as she
exclaimed, &ldquo;Yes, I do think you are queer, if queer
means different from those other girls.&rdquo; Then she
laughingly confessed, &ldquo;The truth is I never had a
girl friend either, not one, but I have lots of make-believe
friends, so, you see, I also am queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in brown beamed, &ldquo;O, I am so glad, for
maybe, do you think possibly you and I might become
friends, being both queer and all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny nodded joyfully. &ldquo;Why, of course we can
be friends if you wish. That is, if Miss Granger
would want you to be friendly with any but the
gentry. Perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t allow the pupils of her
school to make acquaintances on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>This thought was not at all troubling to the
strange girl. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she began seriously, &ldquo;I
am not subject to the rules governing the other
pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, noting the puzzled expression in the listener&rsquo;s
eyes, she leaned back against the tree as she
laughingly continued: &ldquo;Suppose I begin at the beginning
and then you will understand about me
once for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know each other&rsquo;s names,&rdquo; Jenny
put in. &ldquo;Mine is Jeanette Warner. I have always
lived with my grandparents on Rocky Point farm,
which belongs to the estate of the Poindexter-Jones
family.&rdquo; A shadow passed over the speaker&rsquo;s face,
which, a moment before, had been so bright. &ldquo;I
want to be real honest before we begin a friendship.
We are not farmers in our own right. We are hired
to run a farm, therefore we are servants in the
employ of the mother of one of your classmates.
At least that is what Gwynette Poindexter-Jones
calls us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The observant listener saw the flush mounting to
her new friend&rsquo;s cheeks, and, impulsively, she
reached out a hand and placed it on the one near
her. &ldquo;What does <i>that</i> matter? I mean so far as
our friendship is concerned,&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Jenny was relieved. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it really? Well,
then I&rsquo;m glad. Now please tell me all about yourself
from the very beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Jenny noticed that her companion looked frail
and so she was not surprised to hear her say that
she had been very ill. &ldquo;Lenora Gale is my name,&rdquo;
she began, &ldquo;and my family consists of an unequalled
father, and of a brother who is just as nice only
younger. My dearest mother died of lung trouble
years ago, and every time since then when I have
caught cold, it has taken my vitality to an alarming
extent, and last fall, when the bitter winter weather
set in, and oh, how cold our northern winters are,
father wanted me sent to California, but he could
not come himself. Brother Charles wished to attend
an agricultural college near Berkeley and so I was
put in a boarding school up there, just as a place to
stay and be well cared for. I was not to attend
classes unless I desired. But the rainy season continued
for so long that Brother thought best to bring
me farther south, and that is why I am now in the
Granger Place Seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny rose and held out a hand. &ldquo;Lenora Gale,&rdquo;
she said seriously, &ldquo;the damp coolness of this canyon
will not do at all for you. I&rsquo;m going to walk
back with you to the top of the trail. I can see
quite plainly that you need a friend to look after
you.&rdquo; And evidently Jenny was right, for the rough
upward climb was hard for the girl who had not
been well, and she scarcely spoke until they said
good-bye at the side door of the seminary. Then
she turned and clung to the hand of her new friend
as she said imploringly, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t just disappear
and forget me, will you? I do so want to see you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not,&rdquo; Jenny assured her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come up
and get you tomorrow, if I may have Dobbin, and
take you home to supper. I want you to meet
Grandma Sue and Grandpa Si.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora&rsquo;s pale face brightened. &ldquo;Oh, how wonderful
that will be. I wish today were tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Jenny descended the Sycamore Canyon
brook trail, but this time she skipped along that she
need not be late to help get supper. At the bridge,
though, she stopped for one moment as at a shrine.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;is where I met my first girl
friend.&rdquo; A lizard on a stone near lifted its gray
head and looked at her with bright black eyes, but
Jenny, with a song of gladness, passed on down
the trail, for once without noticing the wild life
about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">DEAREST DESIRES</span></h2>
<p>On the day following the meeting of the two
girls on the rustic bridge over Maiden Hair Falls,
Jenny, true to her promise, drove to the seminary
ostensibly to deliver an order of honey and eggs, but
a girl in brown rode with her on the high front
seat when Dobbin turned out of the school gates.
Another girl was watching them from her wide,
upper window. Turning back into the room, she
remarked to two others who were trying to study:
&ldquo;That Lenora Gale must belong to the bourgeoise.
She is actually going for a ride with the granddaughter
of my mother&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia Sullivan turned a page in the book she
was conning and remarked without looking up:
&ldquo;Gwyn, how can you expect to win honors if you
never open your books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl addressed sank languidly into a comfortable
chair, picked up her novel and replied, as she
found her place: &ldquo;<i>Me</i>, win honors? <i>Why should I</i>,
pray? Does it make one a more winsome debutante?
You must know that this is to be my last year of
confinement within the walls of a seminary. Ma
Mere has promised to give me a coming-out party
when I am eighteen which will dazzle even blas&eacute;
San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah arose, as she said rather impatiently:
&ldquo;Well, Gwyn, just because <i>you</i> do not wish to learn
is no reason why Pat and I should follow in your
footsteps. I&rsquo;m going to our own room where I can
study uninterrupted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo; Patricia arose to accompany
her friend. &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette, having found her place, was too absorbed
in her story to reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Meanwhile Jenny and Lenora were having the
happiest kind of time riding down the gently sloping
hill, now in the sunlight and again in the shadow of
great overhanging trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anything pleasant happened since yesterday?&rdquo;
Lenora asked with a side glance at the beaming
face of the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; the other girl nodded gleefully.
&ldquo;I passed 100 per cent in two subjects and over 90
per cent in all the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brown eyes of her companion were questioning.
&ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t know you were going to have
examination. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t know anything about
your school. Is there one near or do you have to
go to Santa Barbara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny told the story of her schooling from its
beginning to a most interested listener. &ldquo;Oh, how
I do envy you.&rdquo; Lenora exclaimed. &ldquo;If I had
had a teacher like your Miss Dearborn, I would be
wiser than I am. We always lived too far away
from a school for me to attend one. Dad has tutored
me when he had time and so has Brother during his
vacations.&rdquo; Then the girl&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;But
my best teachers have been books themselves. How
I have enjoyed them! Dad ordered all of the books
in a graded reading course for me, and I have shelf
after shelf filled with them around the walls of my
room. I especially like nature poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Jenny flashed a bright smile at her companion.
&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Miss Dearborn is
teaching me to love it. She wants me to be able to
quote some poem that will describe every beautiful
thing in nature that I see. Of course, I can&rsquo;t always
think of one, but then I store the scene away in my
memory and ask Miss Dearborn what poem it would
suggest to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would love to know your teacher,&rdquo; Lenora
said. &ldquo;I believe I could learn rapidly if I had her
to teach me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost the end of the school year,&rdquo; Jenny
commented, as she looked up and down the Coast
Highway before crossing it, &ldquo;and, anyway, I suppose
it would hardly do for a pupil of the seminary
to be taught by someone outside when they have
special teachers there for all subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; her companion agreed.
Then, as they started down the long narrow lane
leading to the farmhouse, the girl in brown exclaimed:
&ldquo;Oh, Jenny, do you live in that picturesque
old adobe house so near the sea? I adore the ocean
and I haven&rsquo;t been real close to it since I came. It&rsquo;s
so very warm today, don&rsquo;t you think we might go
down to the very edge of the water and sit on the
sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny nodded brightly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go out on Rocky
Point,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll love it, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Then
impulsively, &ldquo;Oh, Lenora Gale, you don&rsquo;t know
what it means to me to have a girl friend who likes
the same things that I like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do know,&rdquo; the other girl replied sincerely,
&ldquo;for it means the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Warner was delighted with Jenny&rsquo;s
new friend, and, as for Lenora, she was most enthusiastic
about everything around the farm. She
thought the old adobe house with its heavy beams
simply fascinating, and when she saw Jenny&rsquo;s very
own room with its windows opening out toward the
point of rocks and the sea, she declared that she
knew, if only she could sleep in a room like that,
she would not be troubled with long hours of wakefulness
as she had been since her last illness. &ldquo;The
ocean sings a lullabye to you all of the time, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; she turned to say.</p>
<p>Jenny, who was indeed pleased with her friend&rsquo;s
phrase, nodded, then she laughingly confessed that
sometimes, when there was a high wind or a storm,
the song of the sea was a little too wild and loud to
lull one to slumber. But her listener&rsquo;s eyes glowed
all the more. &ldquo;How I would love to hear it then.
I would want to stay awake to listen to the crashing
of the waves.&rdquo; Then she said: &ldquo;I suppose you think
me foolishly enthusiastic about it, but when one has
lived for years and years on an inland prairie, the
sea is very strange and wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Jenny nodded understandingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
I could live far away from the coast,&rdquo; she commented.
&ldquo;I would feel as though a very important
part of my life had been taken from me. I have always
lived within sound of the sea, but come, I want
to take you down to the Rocky Point.&rdquo; The girls
went again through the kitchen, and Jenny said to
the dear little old lady who was sitting on the vine-hung
side porch, busy, as always, with her sewing,
&ldquo;Grandma Sue, please let Lenora and me get the
supper. We won&rsquo;t be gone more than an hour and
after that will be plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Warner,
how I wish you would let us. It would be such a
treat to me. I love to cook, but it has been perfect
ages since I have been allowed in a kitchen, and
yours is so homey and different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner nodded a pleased consent. &ldquo;I
reckon you may, if it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo; to do,&rdquo;
she said. Then she dropped her sewing in her lap,
pushed her spectacles up among the lavender ribbons
of her cap and gazed after the two girls as
they went hand in hand down the path that led
toward the Rocky Point. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasant sight,&rdquo;
the old woman thought, &ldquo;Jenny having a friend of
her own kind at last, and her, being a farmer&rsquo;s gal,
makes our darlin&rsquo; feel right at home wi&rsquo; her. Not
one of the upstandin&rsquo; sort like Gwynette Poindexter-Jones.&rdquo;
There was seldom a hard expression on the
loving old face, but there was one at that moment.
The spectacles had been replaced and Susan Warner
began to stab her needle into the blue patch she was
putting on a pair of overalls in a manner that suggested
that her thoughts were of no gentle nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>right</i> has <i>one</i> of &rsquo;em to be puttin&rsquo; on airs
over the other of &rsquo;em? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to be
told. They bein&rsquo; flesh and blood sisters even if one
of &rsquo;em has been fetched up grand. But I reckon
there&rsquo;s a justice in this world, an&rsquo; I can trust it to
take keer o&rsquo; things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having reached this more satisfactory state of
mind, the old woman again glanced toward the point
and saw the two girls climbing out on the highest
rock. Jenny was carefully holding her friend&rsquo;s
hand and leading her to a wide boulder against
which the waves had crashed in many a storm until
they had cut out a hollow resembling a canopy-covered
chair wide enough for two to sit comfortably.</p>
<p>It was low tide at that hour, and, when they were
seated, Lenora exclaimed joyfully: &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t this
the nicest place for confidences? Let&rsquo;s tell each other
a secret, shall we? That will make us intimate
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny smiled happily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I have any
secrets, that is, none of my own that I could share.&rdquo;
Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s secret was the only one she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s tell our dearest desires,&rdquo; Lenora suggested,
&ldquo;and I will begin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Then she laughingly confessed: &ldquo;It will not take
long to tell, however. I want to grow strong and
well that I may become father&rsquo;s housekeeper. It is
desperately lonely for him with both Mother and me
away, and yet, since his interests are all bound up
in our Dakota farm, he cannot leave it, and so, you
see, I must get well as soon as ever I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny nodded understandingly. &ldquo;My dearest desire
is to find a way by which I can help Grandpa Si
buy Rocky Point farm. I have thought and thought,
but, of course, just thinking doesn&rsquo;t help much.
There are ten acres in it, from the sea back to the
highway, and then to the tall hedge you can see over
there. That is where the Poindexter-Jones&rsquo; grounds
begin, and in the other direction to where the canyon
brook runs into the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful little farm. I wish you could
buy it. How much do you suppose it will sell for?&rdquo;
Lenora asked, but Jenny did not know. Then she
sighed as she added that she supposed they would
know soon, for the daughter of Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
had said that it was to be sold in the summer
when her mother returned from France. But, as it
was not natural for Jenny to be long depressed, she
smilingly announced that she had two other desires
that were very dear. One was that she did so want
her wonderful teacher to remain in California another
winter. &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t, if Miss Dearborn
goes back East, I will have to go to the Santa Barbara
High School next year, and no one knows how
I would dread that. I even dread going there for a
few days next month to take the written examinations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Jenny had one more desire, which she did not
mention, but, as she glanced across the green field
and saw the turrets of the deserted Poindexter-Jones
home, she thought of Harold and wondered
when he would come again. He had said that he
would run down some time soon and have dinner
with them. Then, surely, she would have an opportunity
to be alone with him long enough to ask
about the farm.</p>
<p>Arousing herself from her thoughts, Jenny
glanced at her companion and saw, on the sweet
face, an expression of infinite sadness. Impulsively
she reached out a strong brown hand and placed it
lovingly over the frail one near her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora, aren&rsquo;t you happy, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brown eyes that were lifted were filled with
tears. &ldquo;There is something sad about the ocean and
Tennyson&rsquo;s poem makes me think of my dear
mother. No one can ever know how I miss her.
We were more like two sisters, even though I was
so very young. Mother died when I was twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What poem is it, dear? Shall you mind repeating
it to me? I haven&rsquo;t had any of Tennyson&rsquo;s
poetry yet.&rdquo; Then Jenny added hastily, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t,
if you would rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to.&rdquo; In a voice that was almost
tearful, Lenora began:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Break, break, break</p>
<p class="t0">On thy cold gray stones, O Sea.</p>
<p class="t0">And I would that my tongue could utter</p>
<p class="t0">The thoughts that arise in me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O well for the fisherman&rsquo;s boy</p>
<p class="t0">That he shouts with his sister at play!</p>
<p class="t0">O well for the sailor lad</p>
<p class="t0">That he sings in his boat on the bay!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And the stately ships go on</p>
<p class="t0">To their haven under the hill!</p>
<p class="t0">But O for the touch of a vanished hand</p>
<p class="t0">And the sound of a voice that is still!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Break, break, break</p>
<p class="t0">At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!</p>
<p class="t0">But the tender grace of a day that is dead</p>
<p class="t0">Will never come back to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, before Jenny could comment on the poem,
Lenora said, smiling through her tears, &ldquo;That is
what the poets do for us: they express our emotions
better than we could ourselves.&rdquo; Not wishing to
depress her friend, she arose, held out a hand as she
entreated: &ldquo;Please help me down to that shining
white sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a happy half hour as they spent and when
at last they started back toward the house, Jenny,
in the shelter of the rocky point, impulsively kissed
her companion. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I
have always wished that I had a sister. I&rsquo;d like to
adopt you if you will let me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will let you. I would rather have
you for a sister than anyone I ever knew.&rdquo; Then,
mischievously, Lenora inquired, &ldquo;Now, what relation
is my brother Charles to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let
<i>him</i> decide when he comes,&rdquo; was Jenny&rsquo;s practical
answer. &ldquo;He may not want to be adopted.&rdquo; Then,
as the house had been reached, she added impulsively,
&ldquo;but Grandma Sue and Grandpa Si would
love to be, so I will let you share them. Now, Sister
Lenora, it&rsquo;s time for us to get supper.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">PEERS OR PIGS</span></h2>
<p>The day of the party to be given in honor of
Clare Tasselwood arrived and the three most interested
were in Gwyn&rsquo;s room dressing for the occasion.
&ldquo;There is something very queer about Clare,&rdquo; Beulah
announced. &ldquo;I just passed her room a moment ago.
The door was open and I saw her sitting in front of
the mirror brushing out that mass of long yellow
hair of hers, and I am positive that she was laughing.
She saw my reflection, I suppose, for the moment
I had passed she got up and closed the door so
quickly that it sounded like a slam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Gwynette, bemoaning the fact that they were not
permitted to have maids assist them with their dressing,
said impatiently: &ldquo;Pat, you&rsquo;ll simply <i>have</i> to
help me with these hooks.&rdquo; Then, to Beulah: &ldquo;What
are you driving at? Why do you think it is queer
that Clare Tasselwood should be laughing? You
laugh sometimes yourself, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I do, if I think of something
funny,&rdquo; Beulah agreed, &ldquo;but what I can&rsquo;t understand
is why Clare Tasselwood should laugh all alone by
herself when she is dressing to go to our party. Of
course she can&rsquo;t have any idea that we are giving it
because we believe her to be the daughter of a
younger son of the English nobility, can she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Gwyn declared. &ldquo;We three are
the only ones who know that and we have not told.
I am more than ever convinced that it is true, for
yesterday, when Madame Vandeheuton asked me to
take Clare&rsquo;s mail to her room there was a letter with
what appeared to be a crest on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia, having finished hooking up the blue satin
gown of her friend, remarked with energy: &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m certainly glad to hear that. I&rsquo;ve had &lsquo;ma doots&rsquo;
lately about the whole thing, and now and then a
faint idea penetrates my brain that we&rsquo;re idiots
whichever way it is. Here we are squandering not
only this month&rsquo;s spending money but next month&rsquo;s
as well, and what is to come of it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Beulah sat on a low stool to put on her gilt slippers.
&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll have to take a gambler&rsquo;s chance.
Pat, be a sport. We know for a fact that there is
a pupil at this seminary who is the daughter of a
younger son of a noble English family. Miss Granger
was only too glad to let <i>that</i> much be known.
I&rsquo;ve no doubt it brought her several pupils whose
vain mothers wished them to be associated with
such a girl even if they could not know which one
she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat agreed. &ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t we study the qualities of
every girl in this establishment, beginning with
Clare and ending with that timid, sickly-looking
creature who always wears brown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who associates, by choice, with the granddaughter
of my mother&rsquo;s servants,&rdquo; Gwyn scoffed
as she surveyed her beautiful party gown in the
long gilt-framed mirror. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it adorable of
Ma Mere to send me this creation from Paris? She
knows how hurt I am because she put me in this
detestable prison instead of permitting me to accompany
her to France, and so she sends me presents to
sooth my wounded spirits, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother is mighty good to you,&rdquo; Pat remarked
in rather a critical tone, &ldquo;better than I think
you deserve. I have never yet heard you say that
you wish you could do something to add to <i>her</i>
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Gwynette crossed the room, watching the swing
of the soft satin folds in the mirror over one
shoulder. Her lips were pressed together as though
she were trying to keep from retorting to her friend&rsquo;s
speech, but her mounting anger caused her to stop
in front of Pat&rsquo;s chair and flare at her. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
understand <i>why</i> you continue to associate with me
at all, since you disapprove of me so entirely. If
you feel that it is an idiotic thing for us to try to do
homage to the daughter of nobility, why didn&rsquo;t you
say so at first? It is too late now to make any
changes in our plans, but after tonight I shall no
longer expect you to be one of my intimate friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah said conciliatingly: &ldquo;Gwyn, we aren&rsquo;t
any of us perfect, and we certainly don&rsquo;t want our
friends to pretend they think we are, do we?&rdquo; Then,
in an entirely different tone, she continued: &ldquo;For
myself, Gwyn, since your brother and fifteen other
cadets are coming to our party, I shall consider my
money well spent. I&rsquo;m pining for a dance. And, as
for the Lady Clare Tasselwood, I don&rsquo;t care a fig
whether she is or isn&rsquo;t. Hark, what&rsquo;s the commotion
without?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The palatial bus from The Palms was arriving
and on the high seat with the driver, resplendent in
his gold-trimmed blue uniform, sat Cadet Harold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Beulah, who had skipped to the front window,
hurried back to don her cloak and tie a becoming
cherry colored scarf over her short light brown curls.
&ldquo;Gwyn, I wish you would be the one to tell Lady
Clare that the hour of departure has arrived. Pat
and I will round up the other twelve.&rdquo; Gwynette
lifted her eyebrows as she adjusted her swansdown-trimmed
cloak about her slim shoulders. &ldquo;Sometimes,
Beulah, from your choice of English, I might
think you a cowgirl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rebuked maiden chuckled mischievously. &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t, though,&rdquo; she said inelegantly, &ldquo;but if ever
there was a romance of the Wild West written that
I haven&rsquo;t read, I hope I&rsquo;ll hear of it soon. I&rsquo;m daffy
about the life. Truth is, I&rsquo;d heaps rather meet a
cowgirl than I would a younger daughter of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gwynette, with a proud toss of her handsome
head, had swept from the room, leaving Beulah to
mirthfully follow, accompanied by Pat, whose dark
looks boded no good. Beulah drew her friend back
and closed the door. &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; she remonstrated,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t take Gwyn&rsquo;s loftiness so much to heart. I
think she is just as superlatively selfish as you do,
and I also think she treats her invalid mother shamefully,
but you know we can&rsquo;t go around this world
telling everyone <i>just</i> what we think of them. It isn&rsquo;t
done in the best society. Gwyn has her good points,
too, otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t have been chumming
with her, would we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, take it from me. I&rsquo;ve chummed my last.
After tonight I&rsquo;ll choose my friends, not have them
chosen for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know as well as I do that because our three
mothers were in the same set at home, we were all
packed off here together, but come, I&rsquo;ll try to get
some pleasure out of this idiotic party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the lower hall, they found
all of the girls who had been invited waiting for
Madame Vandeheuton, who was to be the evening&rsquo;s
chaperone. She was a timid little French woman
who felt that the girls were always making fun of
her efforts at speaking English, and so she usually
kept quiet, except when she was teaching her dearly
loved native tongue. Gwynette had especially asked
that Madame Vandeheuton be permitted to accompany
them, since they could not go without one of
the teachers.</p>
<p>Clare Tasselwood was gorgeously arrayed in a
brocaded gold velvet gown with a crownlike arrangement
of pearls bound about her mass of soft yellow
hair. She looked more than ever regal. Gwynette
sat beside her in the bus and was her constant companion
throughout the evening. The ballroom of
The Palms had been reserved for this party and the
fifteen cadets were charmed with the pretty girls
from the select seminary, but handsome Clare was
undeniably the belle.</p>
<p>Each time that a dance was concluded, Gwyn
asked her partner to take her to that part of the
salon to which Clare&rsquo;s partner had taken her.</p>
<p>Harold Poindexter-Jones noticed this after a time
and asked slangily: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea, Sis? Is
the tall blonde a new crush?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Gwyn&rsquo;s haughty reply was: &ldquo;Harold, I consider
your language exceedingly vulgar. If you wish to
know, this party is being given in honor of Clare
Tasselwood, whose father is a younger son of
English nobility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother looked at her in wide-eyed amazement,
then burst into a laugh. Indignantly Gwyn
drew him through an open door, out upon a deserted
porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by such an ill-mannered
explosion?&rdquo; she inquired wrath fully.</p>
<p>Harold became very sober. &ldquo;Sis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are
you in dead earnest? Has that girl been telling any
such yarn about her family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no,&rdquo; Gwyn had to confess, &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t tell
it, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the boy laughed: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too good to
keep. I&rsquo;ll have to tell the fellows. Old Hank Peters,
the chap who has danced with her so much, comes
from her part of the globe&mdash;Chicago, to be accurate,
and he said that her father made his pile raising
pigs&mdash;and they aren&rsquo;t English at all. They are
Swedes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette was angry with herself and everyone
else. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to tell; not a single soul!&rdquo;
she flared. &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll get even with you some
time, some way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>The boy, suddenly serious, took his sister&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Gwyn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have no desire to make this a
joking matter with the fellows. Of course I&rsquo;ll keep
it dark, but I do hope it will teach you a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah and Pat wondered at Gwynette&rsquo;s altered
manner toward the guest of honor, but, not even to
them did she confide the humiliating information
she had received.</p>
<p>On the ride back to the seminary in the bus Gwyn
had very little to say and the others attributed it to
weariness.</p>
<p>Gwynette noticed a merry twinkle in the blue
eyes of Clare Tasselwood when she effusively bade
the three hostesses good-night, assuring them that
she had spent a most delightful evening. Gwyn
went sulkily to her room almost <i>sure</i> that the
daughter of that pig-raising Westerner had known
all along <i>why</i> the party had been given. She had
indeed learned a lesson she decided as she closed
her room door far less gently than she should have
done at that hour of night. Before retiring she
assured herself that even if she found out who
<i>really was</i> the daughter of a younger son of English
nobility, she wouldn&rsquo;t put <i>herself</i> out to as much as
speak to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">GOOD NEWS</span></h2>
<p>Sunday morning dawned gloriously, and
although the sun rose at an early hour, Jenny was
out on the Rocky Point to watch the crimson and
gold shafts of light flaming up back of the mountain
peaks; then she looked out at the sea with its
opalescent colors. Turning, she saw someone walking
along the beach from the house beyond the high
hedge.</p>
<p>It was not hard to recognize the military bearing
of the youth. As the girl had not known of the
party given on the previous evening at The Palms,
she had no knowledge of the near presence of the
lad whom she had so longed to see, that she might
ask about the farm. Harold had said nothing to
his sister Gwynette of his determination to remain
over night, but when his comrades had departed for
the big city far to the north, he had climbed into his
little gray speeder and had gone to the deserted
mansion-like home belonging to his mother.</p>
<p>Being without a thought of fear, the lad had not
in the least minded the ghastliness of the spacious
rooms where the furniture wore coverings of white
and where his footsteps awakened echoes long silent.
He had slept in his own bed, but had aroused early,
meaning to breakfast with his old nurse and her
family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>When he saw the girl standing on the highest
rock of the points with the shining morning sky
back of her, he snatched off his cap and waved it,
then broke into a run, which soon took him scrambling
up the rocks to her side.</p>
<p>Holding out a strong brown hand, he exclaimed,
real pleasure glowing in his eyes: &ldquo;Why, little
Jenny Warner, how tall you are, and graceful, like
a flower on a slender stem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed merrily. &ldquo;Do boys always feel
that they must say pretty things to their girl acquaintances?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>As he gazed into her liquid brown eyes with their
tender depths, the lad suddenly found himself wishing
that he were a poet, that he might say something
truly fitting, but as words failed him, he confessed
that most girls seemed to like to receive
compliments. How innocent was the expression of
the sweet face that was lifted toward his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, do they?&rdquo; Then she confessed: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know many girls, only one&mdash;a farmer&rsquo;s daughter
who is over at Granger Place Seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad raised his eyebrows questioningly. Then
he began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A farmer&rsquo;s daughter, is she? Well, I&rsquo;m glad
there is <i>one</i> pupil at that school who is honest about
her family.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Then noting that his companion was looking at
him as though wondering what he meant, he explained
in an offhand way, not wishing to break his
promise to his sister: &ldquo;Oh, I just heard that some
one of the girls in that school is supposed to be the
daughter of a younger son of the English nobility.&rdquo;
Adding quickly: &ldquo;You say that you are acquainted
with only one girl. Hasn&rsquo;t my sister Gwyn been
over to call on the Warners yet, and haven&rsquo;t you
met her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A color that rivaled the rose in the sky flamed into
Jenny&rsquo;s face. Harold saw it and correctly concluded
that the girls <i>had</i> met, and that Jenny had been
rudely treated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwyn is a snob,&rdquo; was his mental comment.
Aloud he said: &ldquo;Do you suppose that your grandmother
will invite me to stay to breakfast? I&rsquo;ll
have to start for the big town by ten, at the latest,
and so I cannot be here for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she will.&rdquo; Jenny glanced back at the
farmhouse as she spoke and saw that the smoke was
beginning to wreath out of the chimney above the
kitchen stove. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re up now, and so I&rsquo;ll go in
and set the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But still she did not move, and the lad watching
her expressive face intently, exclaimed impulsively:
&ldquo;Jenny, is something troubling you? Can&rsquo;t I help
if there is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>That Harold&rsquo;s surmise had been correct the lad
knew before the girl spoke, for her sweet brown
eyes brimmed with tears, and she said in a low,
eager voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I have wanted to see you to ask about
the farm. I heard, I overheard your sister telling
her two friends from San Francisco that when your
mother comes from France the farm is to be sold,
and if it is, dear old Grandpa and Grandma will
have no place to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An angry color had slowly mounted the tanned
face of the boy, and he said coldly: &ldquo;My sister presumes
to have more knowledge of our mother&rsquo;s
affairs than she has. The farm is <i>not</i> to be sold
without my consent. Mother has agreed to that.
I have asked for Rocky Point and the Maiden Hair
Falls Canyon for my share of the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked out over the water thoughtfully before
he continued: &ldquo;Mother, I will confess, thinks my
request a strange one, since the home and the fifteen
acres about it are far more valuable, and she will
not consent to the making of so unequal a division
of her property, but she did promise that she would
not sell the farm until I wished it sold. I believe
she suspects that when I finish my schooling I may
plan to become a gentleman farmer myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad laughed as though amused, but as he
looked intently at the lovely girl before him, he became
serious and exclaimed as though for the first
time he had thought of considering it:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, after all, I might do worse. I simply
will not go into the army. I should hate that life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, catching the girl&rsquo;s hand, he led her down
the rocks as he called gayly: &ldquo;Come on, little Jenny
Warner, let&rsquo;s ask your grandfather if he will begin
this very summer to teach me how to be a farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was a few moments later, when Grandpa
Si came from the barn with a pail brimming
with foamy milk, that he was almost bumped into
by a girl and boy who, hand in hand, were running
joyfully from the other direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I&rsquo;ll be dod-blasted!&rdquo; the old man exclaimed,
&ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t little Harry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he called: &ldquo;Grandma Sue, come an&rsquo; see
who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright-eyed old woman appeared in the open
door, fork in hand. The lad leaped up the porch
steps and kissed her on a flushed, wrinkled cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma Sue,&rdquo; he asked merrily, &ldquo;have you
room for a starved beggar boy at your breakfast
table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room, is it?&rdquo; was the pleased response. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;ll
allays be that, sonny, whenever you&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo; a bite
to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a merry meal followed. No one could make
pancakes better than Susan Warner, and when the
first edge was taken from his appetite, Harold insisted
on helping Jenny turn the cakes for the other
two. He wondered what Gwynette would think and
say, if she could see him, but for that he cared not
at all. Then, when they were seated, the boy astonished
the farmer by asking if he were willing to take
him on that coming summer as a helper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tush! Nonsense it is yo&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; now, Harry
boy. Yo&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t want to be puttin&rsquo; on overalls,
would ye, an&rsquo; be milkin&rsquo; ol&rsquo; Brindle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Harold was in dead earnest, they were finally
convinced, and when at last he started away along
the beach it was with the understanding that he was
to return the first of June to be Farmer Warner&rsquo;s
&ldquo;helper.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">PRIDE MEETS PRIDE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thanks be there are only two more weeks
of incarceration in this prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette Poindexter-Jones was in no pleasant
mood as her two companions could easily discern.
&ldquo;I would simply expire of ennui if I had to remain
here one day longer. When I think that Ma Mere,
after having had a wonderful winter in France, is
now arriving in San Francisco, where I suppose she
will remain for a time, I feel as though I never can
stand the stupid routine of this place even a fortnight
longer. And the truth is, I don&rsquo;t know as I
will. I wrote Mother that I had refused to take the
final tests. I cannot see why I should care for a
diploma from this seminary, or any other, since I
am next year to become a debutante in San Francisco&rsquo;s
best society. One doesn&rsquo;t have to pass an
examination in history, thank heavens, to make an
eligible marriage. Beauty is far more requisite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you are quite satisfied with yourself
on that score.&rdquo; It was Beulah Hollingsworth
who made this sarcastic remark. The three girls
were seated in the summer-house on the lawn of the
seminary waiting for the arrival of the rural postman.
A box of chocolates lay open on the table
before them, and, spread about it, were books and
magazines. Patricia Sullivan, to the displeasure of
at least one of her friends, was reading a romance
of the West. She had not heard the remarks of her
companions until the last sentence had been uttered
and the tone in which it had been said made her
look up and exclaim: &ldquo;What is the matter, Beulah?
Your disposition used to be quite amiable, but it
certainly is changing. Are you living on vinegar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette tossed her head. &ldquo;Her favorite pastime
seems to be finding something to be sarcastic about.
Of course I know that I am no rare beauty, but I do
believe that I can hold my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah reached over and took an especially luscious
looking chocolate. As she did so, the driveway
for a moment was in her vision. A crunching of
wheels attracted her attention and she saw an old-fashioned
wagon drawn by a heavy white horse. A
girl, dressed in yellow and wearing a wide-brimmed
hat wreathed with buttercups, was the driver.
Beulah said: &ldquo;If you would like to see a girl who
has real claim to beauty, cast your glance out of the
summer-house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Patricia closed her book and, rising, sauntered to
the rose-hung doorway. Turning, she said in a low
voice: &ldquo;Gwyn, isn&rsquo;t that the girl we saw at your
Rocky Point Farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indignant, because Jenny Warner&rsquo;s beauty had
been compared with her own, Gwynette replied with
great indifference, as she purposely turned her back:
&ldquo;I neither know nor care. I have no interest in my
mother&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was quite evident by Jenny&rsquo;s manner that
she had some interest in the summer-house, for she
drew rein, and called in her prettiest manner: &ldquo;Can
you tell me where I will find Miss Poindexter-Jones?
I have a message for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia good-naturedly replied: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have
far to hunt. Her highness is holding court in this
very summer-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette&rsquo;s groundless anger against the world in
general but increased when she heard the inquiry,
and she snapped as Patricia turned toward her: &ldquo;If
that girl has a message for me, tell her to bring it to
me at once, though I am sure I cannot conceive what
it can be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Jenny, who had clearly heard every word that had
been spoken, as indeed Gwynette had intended that
she should, replied, not without pride in her tone:
&ldquo;Kindly tell Miss Poindexter-Jones that I will send
the message to Miss Granger and she may receive it
from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this was not all pleasing to the haughty girl.
She did not wish to have a needless audience with
the woman who disapproved of her conduct as she
well knew. Appearing in the doorway, she said
angrily: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bring me the message,
if you have one for me? I shall report your behavior
to my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny said nothing, but, picking up the reins, she
was about to drive on to the school when Gwynette
stepped out of the summer-house saying: &ldquo;Kindly
give me whatever message you have for me. I do
not wish it taken to Miss Granger.&rdquo; Jenny took
from her basket a letter, which she handed to the
girl, and for one moment, and for the first time, they
looked straight into each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Gwynette glanced at the envelope, then, handing
it back toward the girl on the high seat of the
wagon, she said disdainfully: &ldquo;You are mistaken,
this letter is addressed to your grandmother and not
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, undisturbed, nodded her agreement. &ldquo;That
is why it came to the farm, but Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
made a mistake. The message is for you.&rdquo;
The girl, standing in the drive, flushed angrily when
she found that this was true. &ldquo;Well, I certainly
hope your grandmother was not snooping enough
to read it,&rdquo; she flashed, desiring to hurt someone&rsquo;s
feelings in an endeavor to relieve her own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>It was Patricia who protested, as she saw the
flaming color in the face Beulah had called beautiful.
&ldquo;Gwyn,&rdquo; she said sharply, &ldquo;I hope the time will
come when you meet someone who will hurt your
feelings as you so enjoy hurting other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny Warner made no response, but drove
around to the kitchen door to deliver the honey and
eggs. When she returned, Gwynette was not in
sight, as she had at once gone to her room to be
alone when she read the letter. She instinctively
knew that it contained a message that would increase
her already belligerent mood.</p>
<p>As she was passing the summer-house, Jenny saw
Patricia Sullivan leap out of the doorway and beckon
to her. &ldquo;Miss Warner,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you
have a few of my chocolates? They&rsquo;re guaranteed
to be sweet clear through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah appeared at her side. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than
can be said of Gwynette Poindexter-Jones. No one
knows how glad I am that at the expiration of a
fortnight I shall have no further need to associate
with her. You, Miss Warner, will be the unfortunate
victim, as you are to have her for a neighbor
all summer, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Jenny, seeing that these girls evidently wished to
be friendly, had again drawn rein and had taken
one of the proffered candies.</p>
<p>Patricia looked rather longingly at the old-fashioned
wagon and then at the placid old white
horse. Her gaze returned to the driver and she said
in her impulsive way: &ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t believe
that it can be true, but it is! I have never ridden in
a conveyance of this kind, and I&rsquo;d just love to try it.
Should you mind if I rode down the canyon road
part way with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Jenny replied with
her brightest smile. &ldquo;There is plenty of room for
both of you.&rdquo; She included Beulah in her invitation.
Then added with a glance at the seminary, &ldquo;if you
are sure that Miss Granger will not mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia scrambled up as she merrily replied:
&ldquo;Why should she care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah remarked: &ldquo;It does seem to me that there
is some archaic rule about not going beyond the
gates without a chaperone, but we each have one.
Miss Warner may chaperone me and I will chaperone
Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed gleefully as though something really
clever had been said. &ldquo;But who will chaperone Miss
Warner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbin will,&rdquo; the driver replied. &ldquo;He usually
does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is jolly fun,&rdquo; Patricia declared a few moments
later when she had requested to drive. Beulah
burst into unexpected merriment. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I hope
her beautiful highness saw us when we drove away.
Her wrath will bring down a volcano of sparks on
our heads when we get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia retorted: &ldquo;Beulah, I sometimes think
that you like to stir up the embers in Gwyn&rsquo;s nature,
even when they are smouldering and might die if
they were let alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of replying, the other girl exclaimed after
a glance at her wrist watch: &ldquo;Great moons! I must
go back on a run! I have a French test at 4.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny took the reins and brought Dobbin to a
stop. When they were in the road, Patricia asked:
&ldquo;May we come down and see you some day? I
wanted to go out on that rocky point when we were
there before, but when Gwyn&rsquo;s along, everything
has to be done her way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to have you,&rdquo; was Jenny&rsquo;s sincerely
given reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">A NEW EXPERIENCE</span></h2>
<p>May was a busy, happy month for Jenny. Never
had she studied harder and her teacher, Miss Dearborn,
rejoiced in her beloved pupil&rsquo;s rapid advancement.
Then, twice a week, on Wednesday and
Saturday afternoons, when she drove around to the
beautiful country homes of the rich delivering eggs
and honey, on the high seat at her side rode her very
first girl friend, Lenora Gale. Jenny was jubilantly
happy on these occasions, and, as for Lenora, she
spent the hours in between the rides in anticipation
of the next one or in dreaming over the last one.
She wrote long letters to her far-away farmer father
or to her nearer brother, Charles, telling all about
this new friend who seemed to the readers of those
letters to be a paragon indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just know that you will love my dear Jenny
when you see her,&rdquo; she wrote indiscriminately in
either letter, and Charles smiled to himself. He
might like this Jenny Warner in a general way, but
he was not at all afraid that he would &ldquo;love&rdquo; any
girl in particular, soon or ever. He was convinced
of that. He had met many girls, but he had never
felt strongly appealed to by any of them, and since
he would be twenty-one on his next birthday he decided
that he was immune, but of this he said nothing
in his letters to his beloved little sister, for he
well knew that she did not refer to romantic love
when she so often prophesied that her brother would
love Jenny Warner.</p>
<p>But, as the weeks passed, Charles found that he
was looking forward with a new interest to the
middle of June, when he was to go to Santa Barbara
to get his sister and take her, if she were well
enough to travel, back to their Dakota farm for the
summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>As for Harold P-J. he had returned to the military
academy jubilantly eager for the beginning of
his duties as Farmer Warner&rsquo;s &ldquo;helper.&rdquo; He wrote
a long, dutiful letter to his mother each week, and,
after that visit to Rocky Point, he told his plan for
the summer not without trepidation and ended with
a description of the flower-like qualities of the granddaughter:
&ldquo;Mother mine, there&rsquo;s a girl after your
own heart. You&rsquo;ll just love Jenny Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of this letter that Mrs.
Poindexter-Jones changed her plans and decided to
leave for Santa Barbara at an earlier date.</p>
<p>At last there came a day when Jenny did not look
about her at the gnarled old oaks or at the carpet of
wild flowers in the uplands as she walked along the
familiar trail which led to Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s pepper-tree
guarded gate, for she was conning over and
over a lesson. Nor was her teacher in the garden
where she so often busied herself as she awaited her
pupil. Instead she stood in the drive with her hat
and jacket on.</p>
<p>When at last the girl lifted her eyes from her
book, she stopped&mdash;an expression of dread and consternation
in her eyes. &ldquo;Miss Dearborn,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t going back East, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>The pleasant-faced woman laughed. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;How you do dread that event, which
I can assure you is not even a remote possibility.
Why should I go East, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny Warner could not explain why she seemed
so often to be oppressed by that dread. &ldquo;Do you
believe that coming events cast their shadows before?&rdquo;
she asked, putting her hand to her throat.
&ldquo;Honestly, Miss Dearborn, I feel as if something
terribly awful is about to happen. And seeing you
just now with your hat and jacket on made me think
that you might have had a telegram and that you
were just leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dearborn merrily put in: &ldquo;I <i>am</i> just leaving,
and for that matter so are <i>you</i>. I received a
telephone message half an hour ago that the date of
the first examination had been changed and is to
take place at 10 o&rsquo;clock <i>this morning</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s books fell to the path and her look of consternation
would have been comical if it had not
been tragic. &ldquo;Miss Dearborn, I knew it! I have
felt just perfectly miserable as though I had lost my
last friend with fifty other calamities added. Now
I know coming events cast their shadows before. I
thought we were going to have all this day for
review.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s reply was cheerfully optimistic.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that we are not. I object to the system
of cramming. You would tire your brain and be
less able to answer questions tomorrow than you are
today. Now take your books into the house, dear,
and leave them on the library table, then hurry back.
We are to catch the nine o&rsquo;clock stage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Poor Jenny&rsquo;s heart felt heavily oppressed. Together
they went down to the Coast Highway, and,
as they had a few moments to wait for the bus in
the rustic little roadside station, Jenny ventured,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Miss Dearborn, it would be a good
plan for you to ask me questions or explain to me
something that you think I do not understand very
clearly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo; Miss Dearborn was emphatic in
her reply. Then she inquired: &ldquo;How is your little
friend Lenora Gale? You promised to bring her up
to have a tea-party with me soon. You haven&rsquo;t forgotten,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shade of sorrow passed over the girl&rsquo;s pretty
face. &ldquo;Miss Dearborn,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;Lenora
isn&rsquo;t as well as she was. I am ever so troubled about
her. She seemed so much better after we met, and
then, last week, she caught another cold. Now she
is worse again, and has to stay in bed. I was up to
the seminary Saturday to take the eggs and honey,
and I asked if I might see her. Miss O&rsquo;Hara went
to inquire of Miss Granger, but she came back without
the permission I wanted. The doctor had requested
that Lenora be kept perfectly quiet. Oh, I
just know that she is fretting her heart out to see
me, and she doesn&rsquo;t like it at the seminary. It&rsquo;s such
a cold, unfriendly sort of a place. The girls never
did take to Lenora, partly because she is retiring,
almost timid, I suppose, and, besides, they may have
heard that her father is only a farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival
of the bus. Then, when they were seated within,
Jenny continued, almost with bitterness: &ldquo;Rich girls
are haughty and horrid, that is, if they are all like
Gwynette Poindexter-Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they aren&rsquo;t, dear. Don&rsquo;t judge the many by
the few. I had many wealthy classmates and they
were as simple and sweetly sincere as any poor girl
could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dearborn purposely kept Jenny&rsquo;s thoughts
occupied with her friend Lenora. Then she asked if
Etta Heldt had been heard from. Jenny shook her
head. &ldquo;We should have heard, at least two weeks
ago. Grandpa Si thinks we never will hear. He
said the best way to lose a friend is to loan him
money, but I have faith in Etta Heldt. I just know
she will write some day soon if she reached Belgium
alive.&rdquo; Miss Dearborn had visited Belgium and she
described that interesting little country, and at last
the bus reached the high school in Santa Barbara.
Jenny, with a glance of terror at her teacher, took
one of her hands and held it hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Throngs of bright-eyed girls, many of them in
short sport skirts and prettily colored sweater coats,
trooped past the two who were strange. Some few
glanced at Jenny casually as though wondering who
she might be, but no one spoke.</p>
<p>Fragments of conversation drifted to her. &ldquo;Gee-whiliker!&rdquo;
a boyish-looking girl exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather have the world come to an end than take the
geom exam from Seer Simp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Simpson, as Jenny knew, was the instructor
in charge of that morning&rsquo;s exams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! Wouldn&rsquo;t I, though?&rdquo; her companion replied
with a mock shudder. Then these two passed
and another group hurried by. The leader turned
to fling over her shoulder: &ldquo;O-o-h!! My hands are
so cold now I won&rsquo;t be able to hold a pen, but if
Monsieur Simpson so much as looks at me with his
steely blue eyes, I&rsquo;ll change to an icicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Jenny found herself confronted
by that same dreaded professor. Miss Dearborn
was introducing her and a kindly voice was saying:
&ldquo;Miss Warner, we are expecting much of you since
you have had the advantage of so much personal
instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the small elderly gentleman were, it
is true, a keen grey-blue, but there was friendliness
in their expression.</p>
<p>Then it was that Jenny realized that since her
tutor had done so much for her, she, in turn, must
do her best, and be, if only she could, a credit to her
beloved friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>A gong was ringing somewhere in the corridor.
As one in a dream, Jenny bade good-bye to Miss
Dearborn, who promised to return at noon. Then
the girl followed her new acquaintance into a room
thronged with boys and girls and sat at the desk
indicated.</p>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">A WELCOME GUEST</span></h2>
<p>Three days later, when Jenny entered the farmhouse
kitchen, Grandpa Si, who was washing at the
small sink pump, looked up twinkling-eyed to inquire:
&ldquo;Wall, Jenny-gal, them examinations are
over now, ain&rsquo;t they? I reckon they wasn&rsquo;t nigh so
terribul as yo&rsquo;d figgered, when you got plumb up to
&rsquo;em, was they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, looking very pale and weary, dropped into
the big armed chair opposite her grandmother, who
was shelling peas for supper.</p>
<p>Then, unexpectedly, she burst into tears. Instantly
the pan of peas was placed on the table and her
grandmother had comforting arms about the girl.
&ldquo;Dearie, what is ailin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;? Warn&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; able to get
the right answers for them examination questions?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>The distressed grandfather also hovered about,
saying huskily: &ldquo;Now look a-here, little un, we don&rsquo;t
keer, not a farthing&rsquo;s worth, whether you knowed
them answers or didn&rsquo;t know &rsquo;em. I reckon you&rsquo;re
smarter&rsquo;n most, how-so-ever, &rsquo;twas.&rdquo; Jenny, who
had been clinging to her grandmother, astonished
them by saying between sobs: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t the examinations
I&rsquo;m crying about. It&rsquo;s Lenora. They let me
see her for a moment this afternoon and she is so
weak and oh so unhappy. She thinks she will never
get well, not if she has to stay in that cold, dreary
old seminary, and Oh, Grandma Sue, how I do want
her to get well. I have always longed to have a
sister, and when I found Lenora Gale, I made believe
she was the sister I had so wanted. No one
knows how I love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old couple were greatly distressed. All these
years their &ldquo;gal&rdquo; had so longed to have a sister of
her very own, and all that time she had had one,
whom she didn&rsquo;t know. Grandma Sue smoothed
the rumpled hair and kissed Jenny on the forehead.
&ldquo;Go to your room, dearie, and rest till supper time,&rdquo;
she said soothingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all tired out with them
examinations. You&rsquo;ll feel better after you&rsquo;ve had
suthin&rsquo; warm to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny permitted her grandfather to help her out
of the chair and to lead her toward her room. There
she flung herself down on her bed, and the loving
old man drew a cover over her. Then he tiptoed
back to the kitchen. &ldquo;Ma,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon us
and Mis&rsquo; Poindexter-Jones have got suthin&rsquo; to answer
for, makin&rsquo; it so them two gals grew up not
knowin&rsquo; as they was sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mabbe so,&rdquo; the old woman had resumed her pea-shelling.
&ldquo;Mabbe so, Silas, but it&rsquo;s too late now.
That proud, haughty gal wouldn&rsquo;t thank no one to
tell her she&rsquo;s our Jenny&rsquo;s sister, and she wouldn&rsquo;t be
no comfort to our gal, bein&rsquo; as she&rsquo;s been fetched up
so different. But that sweet Lenora Gale, her as is
a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, she&rsquo;s a friend more suitin&rsquo; to
our Jenny.&rdquo; For a few moments the old woman&rsquo;s
fingers were busy, but she was silent and thoughtful.
When the peas were ready for the pot, she
poured them into the boiling water, then turned and
said: &ldquo;Silas Warner, you and me keer more to have
Jenny happy than anything else, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we do, Ma. What be yo&rsquo; aimin&rsquo; at?
I kin see easy thar&rsquo;s suthin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; want to say. I&rsquo;m
agreeable to it, whatever &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman seemed relieved. &ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo;
as how it would please our Jenny if we was to let
her invite her friend Lenora to visit her here a spell.
Jenny could sleep on the couch in the livin&rsquo; room,
and let the sick gal have her bed. I think more&rsquo;n
half what&rsquo;s the matter with Lenora Gale is that she&rsquo;s
pinin&rsquo; for a place that&rsquo;s home wi&rsquo; folks in it to keer
for her. Jenny says she&rsquo;s allays speakin&rsquo; of her ma,
lonesome-like, because she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man blew his nose hard, then said blinkingly:
&ldquo;Pore little gal! I was jest a thinkin&rsquo; how
it might o&rsquo; been our Jenny that was sick up to that
school prison wi&rsquo; no one as really keered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s joy knew no bounds when she learned that
she might invite her dear friend Lenora Gale to
come to her home and make her a real visit. So sure
was she that the sick girl would accept, Jenny was
up the next day with the sun. Tying a towel about
her curly light brown hair and donning an all-over
apron, she swept and scoured and dusted her very
own room until it fairly shone. Then she brought
in a basket of flowers and put a tumbler full of them
in every place where it would stand, with a big bowl
of roses on the marble-topped center table. When
Grandma Sue called her to breakfast, she skipped to
the kitchen and, taking the old couple each by an
arm, she led them to the door of her room, singing
out: &ldquo;What do you think of that as a bower for
the Princess Lenora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, now,&rdquo; said the old man admiringly, &ldquo;if
our gal ain&rsquo;t got it fixed up handsome. I reckon
your little friend&rsquo;ll get well in no time wi&rsquo; you waitin&rsquo;
on her, and so much cheeriness to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not until they were seated about the table
eating their breakfast that Jenny suddenly thought
of the possibility that something might happen to
prevent Lenora from coming that day. &ldquo;Maybe
she&rsquo;ll have to write and ask her daddy or her brother
and wait for an answer.&rdquo; For a moment this fear
shadowed the shining face, but it did not last long.
As soon as the breakfast was over she sprang up
and began to clear things away, but her grandmother
gently took a dish from her hand. &ldquo;Thar
now, dearie, you have no need to help. I reckon
you&rsquo;re eager to be drivin&rsquo; over to the seminary.
You&rsquo;d better start right off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Impulsively the girl kissed a wrinkled cheek of the
old woman. &ldquo;Oh, Granny Sue, was there ever any
other person quite so understanding as you are? I&rsquo;ll
go, if you&rsquo;ll promise not to do a single thing but the
dishes while I am away. Please leave the churning
for me to do when I come back with Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut!&rdquo; said her grandfather. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get
your heart set on fetchin&rsquo; that Lenora gal back with
you right to onct. Like as not she won&rsquo;t be strong
enough to ride along of Dobbin today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jenny would not allow herself to be discouraged.
&ldquo;Time enough for that when I find
Lenora can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; she confided to Dobbin while
she was harnessing that faithful animal. He looked
around at her, not without curiosity, as though he
wondered why it was his little mistress was so often
elated. Impulsively, Jenny hugged him as she said:
&ldquo;Oh, Dob, you old dear, you have no idea how happy
I am, nor who it is you are going to bring back to
Rocky Point Farm. Have you, now?&rdquo; She peered
around his blinder, but seeing only a rather sleepily
blinking eye, she climbed upon the high seat of the
wagon, backed from the barn and, turning to wave
toward the house, she drove out of the lane singing
at the top of her sweet voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>No vehicle was in sight as she carefully crossed
the wide Coast Highway. Her granddad had told
her always to come to a full stop before driving
across, as there were often processions of high-powered
cars passing their lane. It was, however,
too early for pleasure-seekers to be abroad and so
Dobbin started climbing the canyon road leading to
the seminary, and even there they met no one.
Jenny&rsquo;s heart was so brimming over with joy that
she could not be quiet. When she was not confiding
her hopes to Dobbin, she was singing.</p>
<p>Suddenly she stopped, for, having reached a turn
in the road, she saw ahead of her a young man on
horseback. He had drawn to one side and was
evidently waiting for the singer to appear. Jenny
flushed, for she knew that he must have heard, as
she had been trying some high soprano arias of her
own composing. The young man had a frank, kind
face with no suspicion of a smile, and so the girl
decided that he was merely waiting for someone
whom he expected, but, as she drew near, he lifted
his cap and asked: &ldquo;Pardon me, but can you tell me
if I am on the Live Oak Road? You have so many
canyon roads about here leading into the foothills.
I am looking for the Granger Place Seminary, where
my sister Lenora Gale is staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny impulsively put her hand to her heart.
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Are you going to take Lenora
away? Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Charles Gale, cap in his hand, gazed inquiringly
at the girl, who hurried on to explain: &ldquo;You see,
Lenora and I are best friends and she is so unhappy
up at that school, where she doesn&rsquo;t know anyone,
really, and she has been so sick, my grandmother
told me I might bring her over to our house to make
a visit. Granny Sue said just as I left, &lsquo;Jenny, tell
your little friend she may stay with us as long as
she wants to, until she is real well, anyway.&rsquo;&rdquo; So
this was Jenny Warner.</p>
<p>The girl paused for breath and the young man,
smiling at her, said sincerely: &ldquo;I am indeed glad to
learn that my sister has so true a friend, indeed,
more than one, I judge, since your grandmother sent
such a kind message to her, but I have come to take
Lenora back with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s ever expressive face registered such disappointment
and sorrow that the young man could
not but add: &ldquo;Suppose we go up to the seminary
together and talk the matter over with my sister.
Perhaps, if she is not strong enough to travel, it may
be well for her to remain with you for a week or
two. I would be glad to leave her in a pleasant
place at least that long, as I shall not be through at
the agricultural college for two weeks yet. Then
I can accompany Lenora back to Dakota where our
father so eagerly awaits her coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Realizing that, as he had not introduced himself
he said: &ldquo;I presume that my sister has mentioned
her brother Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I knew you at once.&rdquo; Jenny&rsquo;s clear
brown eyes gazed out at him with friendly interest.
&ldquo;You look like Lenora, though I can&rsquo;t say just
how.&rdquo; Then, as she again started Dobbin up the
hill road, she beamed at her companion as she said:
&ldquo;This is going to be a happy day for your sister.
How surprised she will be, and how glad! And I&rsquo;m
glad that I met you, for Miss Granger might have
said that Lenora could not visit me, but if you say
that she can, no one else will have any authority.&rdquo;
Then impulsively: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be your friend
forever and ever.&rdquo; Then with one of her sudden
changes, Jenny flashed a bright look at him, as she
pointed ahead: &ldquo;There, did you ever see a view
like that before?&rdquo; They had reached the top of the
hill road and were near the seminary gate.</p>
<p>The view across the valley to the towering mountains
was indeed magnificent. Then Jenny looked
back of her and again pointed, this time toward the
sea. &ldquo;That is Rocky Point, just below the canyon
road,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that old adobe is our farmhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles was much impressed with the beauty of
it all, and, as his gaze wandered back to the glowing
face of the girl, he heard rather than thought,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just love Jenny Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Aloud he asked: &ldquo;And is this the seminary?&rdquo;
His companion nodded and led the way between the
high stone gate posts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d better wait outside while you go in
and see Miss Granger,&rdquo; Jenny suggested when they
drew rein at the front of the seminary.</p>
<p>But Charles Gale would not agree to that. Having
dismounted, he fastened the reins about a hitching
post and asked if his companion could safely leave
her horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed,&rdquo; Jenny replied brightly. &ldquo;Dobbin
wouldn&rsquo;t move until I came again, if it was
never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they went up the wide stone steps and
Charles lifted the iron knocker. A maid admitted
them, staring in amazement when she saw the girl,
who delivered eggs and honey at the kitchen door,
arriving at the front with a fine-looking young man
in a golfing costume.</p>
<p>Charles, not knowing of this, could not understand
the surprised expression directed at his companion.
Jenny smiled and said &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; in
her usual pleasant way. Having asked to see Miss
Granger, he presented his card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk in,&rdquo; the maid said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Miss Granger
that you&rsquo;re here, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were alone in the prim little reception
room, Jenny confided:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maggie has never seen me coming to the front
door. My grandfather raises chickens and bees, and
I often deliver honey and eggs around at the back
door. Perhaps Miss Granger may think it queer
if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t queer!&rdquo; Charles interrupted
with emphasis. &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s best friend has the
right to enter the front door of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He did not
complete his sentence, but rose instead, for a stately,
rather haughty appearing woman had appeared. The
visitor was warmly received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gale, I am indeed pleased that you have
come. Poor little Lenora has not been at all well
of late, and that is why I sent for you. She has
been at perfect liberty to do as she wished, as you
requested, but she contracts frequent colds, and this
last one has lingered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Granger hesitated, then confessed. &ldquo;The
truth is, your sister does not seem to be real happy
here. She is timid and does not care to mingle with
her schoolmates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she added frankly: &ldquo;I find that, on the
whole, the young ladies are rather heartless. They
do not make an effort to include in their pleasures
one who is naturally reserved and who, in turn,
seems to care nothing at all about being included.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Miss Granger, on entering the room, had bowed
somewhat distantly to Jenny Warner, whom she
did not recognize, as she had seldom seen her.
Charles, noting this, asked: &ldquo;Miss Granger, are you
acquainted with little Miss Warner, whose grandfather
is a farmer in this neighborhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman, whose manner was rather frigid at
all times, lifted her eyebrows ever so slightly as
though marveling that a young man whose sister
attended her select seminary should be found in the
companionship of a hired farmer&rsquo;s granddaughter.</p>
<p>Their own father, Mr. Gale, might own a farm,
but that was very different, as he had countless acres
of wheat lands, she understood, and was very rich,
while the Warners were merely hired to conduct a
small farm belonging to the Poindexter-Jones estate.
All this went quickly through the woman&rsquo;s thoughts
and she was astonished to hear the young man
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have decided, Miss Granger, to remove my sister
to the farm home of Miss Warner for the two
weeks remaining before I complete my studies at the
Berkeley Agricultural College. My sister is very
fond of Miss Jenny, and I feel that the companionship
she will have in that home will do much to help
her recover the strength she will need for the long
journey to Dakota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Granger prided herself on being able to hide
all emotions, and on never expressing surprise, but
she could not resist saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was unaware of this friendship, which is the
result, no doubt, of the freedom of action which you
wished your sister to have, but if it is a friendship
sanctioned by Lenora&rsquo;s brother, I, of course, can say
nothing concerning it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, she held out her hand: &ldquo;I will have Miss
Gale&rsquo;s trunk packed at once, and shall I have it sent
to the Poindexter-Jones farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you please, and thank you, Miss Granger,
for your many kindnesses to my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cold nod toward the girl and with a formal
reply to Charles&rsquo; polite speech, she swept from
the room. The lad turned with an amused smile
toward his companion. In a low voice he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand now why Sister never wrote me
that I would be sure to love Miss Granger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles was shocked indeed at the appearance of
the sister who was dearer to him than life itself.
Pale and so wearily she came into the room leaning
on the school nurse. Throwing her arms about her
brother&rsquo;s neck she clung to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so lonely
for mother lately,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I dream of her
often just as though she were alive and well. Then
I am so happy, but I waken and realize that mother
is never coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, much moved, pressed his cheek
close to the tear-wet one of the girl. &ldquo;I know, darling,
I know.&rdquo; Then, striving to keep a break out
of his voice, he said cheerily: &ldquo;See who is here,
Sister. Someone of whom you have often written
me. And she has a wonderful plan to suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Lenora smiled wanly and held out a frail white
hand. &ldquo;I love Jenny Warner,&rdquo; she said as though
informing her brother of something he already
knew. Then she asked, looking from one to the
other: &ldquo;Where am I going? Home to father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite yet, dear girl,&rdquo; her brother replied.
&ldquo;Jenny&rsquo;s grandmother has invited you to visit them
for two weeks, or rather, until I am through with
my studies, then, if you are strong enough, I will
take you home to Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Lenora could express her pleasure, the
ever watchful nurse stepped forward, saying: &ldquo;Miss
Gale ought not to be kept standing. Miss Granger
has ordered the closed carriage and bade me accompany
my patient to her destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Charles found it hard to keep a
note of anxiety out of his voice when Lenora sank
into a near chair and began to cough. He followed
the nurse from the room when she went to get her
wraps. &ldquo;Please tell me my sister&rsquo;s condition,&rdquo; he
said in a low, troubled voice. &ldquo;Her lungs are not
affected, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am glad to say they are not. The trouble
seems to be in her throat.&rdquo; Then, after a thoughtful
moment, the nurse added, glancing about to be
sure that no one was near: &ldquo;I would not wish to
be quoted, but I believe Miss Gale&rsquo;s recovery depends
upon her being in an environment which she will
enjoy. Here she is very lonely and broods continually
for the mother who is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for having told me.&rdquo; Charles was
indeed grateful to the nurse, whose name he did
not know. &ldquo;I shall see that such an environment is
found for my dear sister if it exists anywhere. Our
mother has been dead for several years, but, as time
goes on, we miss her more and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the nurse said as though she, too,
had had a similar loss, then she glided quietly away.</p>
<p>On returning to the reception room, Jenny suggested
that she would better go at once to the farmhouse
that she might be there to welcome Lenora
and the nurse. Charles agreed that the plan was a
good one, and so, tenderly kissing her friend, Jenny
went out; the young man opening the door for her.</p>
<p>When she had driven away, Charles returned to
his sister, who smiled up at him faintly as she said:
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I right, Charles? Isn&rsquo;t Jenny the sweetest,
dearest girl you ever saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her brother shook his head. &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo;
he said, emphatically, taking one of the listless hands
from the arm of the chair. &ldquo;The sweetest, dearest
girl in this world to me is your very own self, and,
although I am quite willing to like any girl whom
you may select as a best friend, you will never get
me to acknowledge that she is sweeter than my very
own sister. However, I will agree that I am pleased
with Miss Jenny Warner to the extent of being willing,
even glad, to have you in the same house with
her until you are strong enough to travel to our
home with me. I&rsquo;ll wire Dad tonight. I have purposely
kept your illness from him. It would be unwise
for him to come here at this time of the year.
We cannot both be away from the farm at seeding
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>The nurse reappeared, saying the coach was waiting.
The young giant of a lad lifted his sister and
carried her out of the seminary which she was
indeed glad to leave.</p>
<p>Jenny and her grandmother were on the side porch
of the picturesque adobe farmhouse when Charles
Gale on horseback rode up, immediately followed by
the closed carriage. Susan Warner with tender pity
in her face and voice, welcomed the pale girl, who
was lifted out of the conveyance by the strong arms
of her brother. Lenora&rsquo;s sweet gray eyes were
brimmed with tears and her lips trembled when she
tried to thank the old woman for her great kindness.
&ldquo;There, there, dearie. Don&rsquo;t try to be sayin&rsquo;
anything now. You&rsquo;re all petered out with the ride.&rdquo;
Then cheerily: &ldquo;Jenny&rsquo;ll show you where to fetch
little Lenora, Mister&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated and the girl at
her side hastened to say: &ldquo;Grandma Sue, this is
Charles Gale, Lenora&rsquo;s brother. Miss Granger had
sent for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The pleasant-faced young man bowed as he apologized
for his inability to remove his hat. His sister
having recovered from her first desire to cry, smilingly
did it for him. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I a giant for a
brother?&rdquo; she asked; then holding out a frail hand
to the nurse, who had descended from the carriage
carrying the wraps and a satchel. Lenora said:
&ldquo;Mrs. Warner, this is Miss Adelaide Wells, who
has been very kind to me.&rdquo; Then, as memory of the
place she had left surged over her, the tears again
came: &ldquo;Oh, brother,&rdquo; she half sobbed, clinging to
him, &ldquo;promise me I&rsquo;ll never, never have to be sent
to a seminary again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course not,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;When
I have finished my schooling you and I will go back
to our farm home and stay there forever and forever.
If you need any further instruction, I can
help you, so put that fear quite out of your thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled, but seemed too weak to make a
reply. Charles followed Jenny through the kitchen
and the cheerful living room into the bedroom which
had been decked in so festive a fashion only that
morning. After the nurse had put Lenora to bed,
she returned to the seminary. The weary girl rested
for a while with her eyes closed, then she opened
them and looked about her.</p>
<p>She found Jenny sitting quietly by her bedside
just waiting. Lenora smiled without speaking and
seemed to be listening to the rush of the waves on
the rocks, then she said: &ldquo;That is the lullabye I
once said I would like to hear in the night. It&rsquo;s like
magic, having it all come to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>She smiled around at the flowers. &ldquo;How sweet
they are! I know that each one tells me some message
of the thoughtfulness and love of my friend.&rdquo;
Holding out a frail hand, Lenora continued: &ldquo;Jenny
Warner, if I live, I am going to do something to
make you glad that you have been so kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pang, like a pain, shot through the listener&rsquo;s
heart. &ldquo;If I live.&rdquo; She had not for one moment
thought that her dear, dear friend might die. She
was relieved to hear the other girl add in a brighter
manner, as though she felt stronger after her brief
rest: &ldquo;I believe now that I shall live, but truly,
Jenny, I didn&rsquo;t care much when I lay all day up there
in that cold, dreary seminary with no one near to
mind whether I stayed or went. But now that I am
here with you in this lovely, cheerful room, somehow
I feel sure that I shall live.&rdquo; Before her companion
could reply, she asked: &ldquo;Where is brother
Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny glanced out of the window. &ldquo;Oh, there he
is, standing on that high rock on the point, the one
that canopies over our seat, you know, where we sat
the last time you were at the farm. Shall I call him,
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora nodded and so Jenny, bareheaded, ran out
toward the point of rocks. Charles, turning, saw
her and went to meet her. &ldquo;Has my sister rested?&rdquo;
he asked. Jenny said that she had, then anxiously
she inquired: &ldquo;Mr. Gale, what does the nurse think?
Lenora is not seriously ill, is she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>There was a sudden shadowing of the eyes that
looked down at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Miss Jenny.
I sincerely hope not. At my request Miss Wells will
send me a daily report of my sister&rsquo;s condition. The
nurse takes a walk every afternoon, and, if your
grandmother is willing, she will stop here until our
little Lenora is much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that a splendid plan. It will be better
than having a doctor call every day.&rdquo; Then brightening:
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Gale, I am sure Lenora will get
well. She is better, come and see for yourself.&rdquo; And
so together they went indoors.</p>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">INGRATITUDE PERSONIFIED</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose is the matter with Gwyn?
Ever since Jenny Warner delivered a note from her
mother Saturday afternoon, she has been as glum
as a&mdash;well, what is glum, anyway?&rdquo; Patricia looked
up from the book she was studying to make this
comment.</p>
<p>Beulah mumbled some reply which was unintelligible,
nor did she cease trying to solve the problem
she was intent upon. Pat continued: &ldquo;I have it
figured out that Gwyn&rsquo;s mother wrote something
which greatly upset our never-too-amiable friend.
She kept shut in her room yesterday, tight as a clam
in its shell. I rapped several times and asked if she
had a headache and if she wished me to bring tea or
anything, but she did not reply.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take it from me, Pat, you waste your good
Samaritan impulses on a person like Gwyn. She is
simply superlatively selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat leaped up and put a hand over her friend&rsquo;s
mouth. &ldquo;I heard the knob turn. I think we are
about to be honored with a visit. Don&rsquo;t be sarcastic,
Beulah. Maybe Gwyn has a real trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This whispered remark had just been concluded
when there came an imperative rapping on the inner
door. Pat skipped to open it. Gwynette, dressed
for the street, entered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the grand idea of
locking the door between our rooms?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know it was locked,&rdquo; Pat replied honestly.
Beulah was again solving the intricate problem, or
attempting to, and acted as though she had not
heard.</p>
<p>Patricia, always the more tender-hearted, offered
their visitor a chair. Then solicitously: &ldquo;What is
the matter, Gwyn. You look as though you had
cried for hours. Bad news in the note Jenny Warner
brought you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a hard expression in the brown eyes
that were turned coldly toward the sympathetic inquirer.
Slowly she said, &ldquo;I sometimes think that I
hate my mother and that she hates me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>There was a quick protest from Pat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say
that, Gwyn, just because you are angry! You have
told me, yourself, that your mother has granted
your every wish until recently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette shrugged her proudly-held shoulders.
&ldquo;Even so! Why am I now treated like a child and
told what I must do, or be punished?&rdquo; Noting a
surprised expression in Patricia&rsquo;s pleasant face,
Gwyn repeated with emphasis: &ldquo;Just exactly that!
If I do not take the tests, or if I fail in them when
they are taken, I cannot have my coming-out party
next year, but must remain in this or some other
school until I obtain a diploma as a graduate with
honors. So Ma Mere informed me in the note
brought by that despicable Jenny Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah could not help hearing and she looked up,
her eyes flashing. &ldquo;Gwynette, if you wish to slander
a friend of Pat&rsquo;s and mine, you will have to choose
another audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyebrows of the visitor were lifted. &ldquo;Indeed?
Since when have you become the champion of the
granddaughter of my mother&rsquo;s servants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beulah&rsquo;s answer was defiant. &ldquo;Pat and I both
consider Jenny Warner one of the most beautiful
and lovable girls we have ever met. We went for a
ride with her on Saturday, and this afternoon, if we
aren&rsquo;t too exhausted after the tests, we are going to
walk down to her farm home and call on her and
upon little Lenora Gale, who has been moved there
from the infirmary.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Gwynette rose, flinging over her shoulder contemptuously,
&ldquo;Well, I see that you have made your
choice of friends. Of course you cannot expect to
associate with me, if you are hobnobbing at the same
time with our servants. What is more, that Lenora
Gale&rsquo;s father is a wheat rancher in Dakota. I, at
least, shall select my friends from exclusive families.
I will bid you good-bye. From now on our intimacy
is at end.&rdquo; The door closed behind Gwyn with an
emphatic bang. Beulah leaped up and danced a jig.
Pat caught her and pushed her back into her chair.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;ll hear and her feelings will be hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s none too tender with other people&rsquo;s
feelings,&rdquo; Beulah retorted.</p>
<p>A carriage bearing the Poindexter-Jones coat-of-arms
and drawn by two white horses was waiting
under the wide portico in front of the seminary
when Gwynette emerged. The liveried footman was
standing near the open door to assist her within,
then he took his place by the coachman and the
angry girl was driven from the Granger Place
grounds.</p>
<p>She did not notice the golden glory of the day;
she did not glance out as she was driven down the
beautiful Live Oak Canyon road, nor did she observe
when the wife of the lodgekeeper opened the
wide iron gates and curtsied to her. She was staring
straight ahead with hard, unseeing eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>When the coach stopped and the footman had
opened the door, the girl mounted the many marble
steps leading to the pillared front porch. Instantly,
and before she could ring, a white-caped maid admitted
her. It was one who had been with them for
years in their palatial San Francisco home, as had,
also, the other servants. &ldquo;Where is my mother,
Cecile?&rdquo; the girl inquired with no word of greeting,
though she had not seen the trim French maid for
many months. The maid&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and her
glance was not friendly. She liked to be treated, at
least, as though she were human. She volunteered
a bit of advice: &ldquo;Madame is veer tired, Mees Gwyn.
What you call, not yet strong. Doctor, he say, speak
quiet where Madame is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn glared at the servant who dared to advise
her. &ldquo;Kindly tell me where my mother is at this
moment. Since she sent the carriage for me, it is
quite evident that she wishes to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame is in lily-pond garden. I tell her Mees
Gwyn has come.&rdquo; But the girl, brushing past the
maid, walked down the long, wide hall which extended
from the front to the double back door and
opened out on a most beautiful garden, where, on
the blue mirror of an artificial pond many fragrant
white lilies floated. There, sheltered from the sea
breeze by tall, flowering bushes, Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
reclined on a softly cushioned chair. Near
her was a nurse in blue and white uniform who had
evidently been reading aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>When Gwynette approached, the older woman
said in a low voice: &ldquo;Miss Dane, I prefer to be
alone when I receive my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse slipped away through the shrubbery
and Mrs. Poindexter-Jones turned again toward the
girl whose rapid step and carriage plainly told her
belligerence of spirit. The pale face of the patrician
woman would have touched almost any heart, but
Gwyn&rsquo;s wrath had been accumulating since her conversation
with Beulah and Pat. She considered
herself the most abused person in existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma Mere,&rdquo; the girl began at once, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
why you didn&rsquo;t let me come to you in France. If
you aren&rsquo;t any stronger than you seem to be, I should
have thought you would have remained where you
were and sent for Harold and me to join you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Gwyn, if you do not care to kiss me.&rdquo;
There was a note of sorrow in the weary voice that
did not escape the attention of the selfish girl.
Stooping, she kissed her mother on the pale forehead.
Then she took the seat vacated by the nurse.
&ldquo;Of course I am sorry you have been sick, Ma
Mere,&rdquo; she said in a tone which implied that decency
demanded that much of her. &ldquo;But it seems to me
it would have been much better for you to have remained
where you were. I was simply wild to have
you send for me while you were at that adorable
resort in France. I can&rsquo;t see why you wanted to
return <i>here</i>.&rdquo; The last word was spoken with an
emphasis of depreciation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Mrs. Poindexter-Jones leaned her head back
wearily on the cool pillow as she said, more to herself
than to her listener, &ldquo;I just wanted to come
home. I wanted to see the trees my husband and
I planted when we were first married. I felt that I
would be nearer him someway, and I wanted to see
my boy. Harold wished me to come home. He
preferred to spend the summer here and I was
glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pity, which for a moment had flickered in the
girl&rsquo;s heart when she saw how very weak her mother
really was, did not last long enough to warm into
a flame. &ldquo;Ma Mere,&rdquo; she said petulantly, &ldquo;I cannot
understand why you never speak of your husband
as my father.&rdquo; There was no response, only a
tightening of the woman&rsquo;s lips as though she were
making an effort to not tell the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; Gwyn went on, not noticing the
change in her mother&rsquo;s manner, &ldquo;why should Harold&rsquo;s
wishes be put above mine? Perhaps you do
not realize that he has become interested, to what
degree I do not know, but nevertheless really interested,
in the granddaughter of your servants on the
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Mrs. Poindexter-Jones turned toward the girl.
There was not in her eyes the flash of indignation
which Gwynette had expected, only surprise and
perhaps inquiry. &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Then, after a
meditative moment the woman concluded, &ldquo;Fate
does strange things. What was it they called her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn held herself proudly erect. At least she
had been sure that her mother would have sided with
her in denouncing Harold&rsquo;s plan to become a farmer
under the direction of Silas Warner. She hurried
on to impart the information without telling the
name of the girl whom she so disliked, although
without reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recall now,&rdquo; was the woman&rsquo;s remark. &ldquo;Jenny
Warner. Jeanette was her name and yours was
Gwynette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angrily her companion put in, &ldquo;Ma Mere, did
you hear me say that Harold has decided to become
a farmer, a mere laborer, when you had planned that
he should become a diplomat or something like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard.&rdquo; The woman leaned back wearily.
&ldquo;My boy wrote me that was why he wanted to stay
here, although he would give up his own wishes if
they did not accord with mine.&rdquo; Then she added,
with an almost pensive smile on her thin lips, &ldquo;He
is more dutiful than my daughter is, one might
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette flung herself about in the chair impatiently.
&ldquo;Harold knows you will do everything to
please him and nothing to please me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she looked at the
hard, selfish face which nevertheless was beautiful
in a cold way.</p>
<p>The woman seemed to be making an effort to
speak calmly. &ldquo;Gwynette,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;we
will call this unpleasant interview at an end. The
fault probably is mine. Without doubt I do favor
Harold. He is very like his father, and I seem to
feel that Harold cares more for me than you do.&rdquo;
She put up a protesting hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer me,
please. I am very tired. You may go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose, somewhat ashamed of herself.
Petulantly, she said, &ldquo;But Ma Mere, must I take the
horrid old test? I will fail miserably and be disgraced.
I supposed I was to make my debut next
winter and I did not consider a diploma necessary
to an eligible marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman had been watching the girl, critically,
but not unkindly. Her reply was in a softer voice.
&ldquo;No, Gwyn, you need not take the tests. Somehow
I have failed to bring you up well.&rdquo; Then to the
listener&rsquo;s amazement, the invalid added: &ldquo;Tell the
coachman, when he returns from the seminary, to
stop at the farm and bring Jenny Warner over to
see me. I would like to know how Susan Warner
succeeded in bringing up her girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette was again angry. &ldquo;You are a strange
mother to wish to compare your own daughter with
the granddaughter of one of your servants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>With that she walked away, and, with a sorrowful
expression the woman watched her going. How she
wished the girl would relent, turn back and fling
herself down by the side of the only mother she had
ever known, and beg to be forgiven and loved, but
nothing was farther from Gwynette&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>Glad as she was to be freed from taking the tests,
she was more than ever angry because she would
have to remain at the seminary until the close of
the term, which was another week. Why would not
her mother permit her to visit some friend in San
Francisco? Then came the sickening realization
that she no longer had an intimate friend. Patricia
and Beulah had both gone over to the enemy. Why
did she hate Jenny Warner, she wondered as she
was being driven back to the school. Probably because
Beulah had once said they looked alike with
one difference, that the farmer&rsquo;s granddaughter was
much the more beautiful. And then Harold actually
preferred the companionship of that ignorant peddler
of eggs and honey to his own sister. Purposely
she neglected to mention to the coachman that he
was to call at the farm and take Jenny Warner back
with him. But Fate was even then planning to carry
out Mrs. Poindexter-Jones&rsquo;s wishes in quite another
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">A SECOND MEETING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora, dearie, can you spare Jenny a spell!
I want her to tote a basket of fresh eggs over to
Poindexter Arms, and a few jars o&rsquo; honey. Like as
not the poor sick missus will be glad of somethin&rsquo;
different and tasty. Don&rsquo;t let her pay for &rsquo;em, Jenny-gal.
Tell her they&rsquo;re a welcome-home present from
all of us. Tell her how we&rsquo;re hopin&rsquo; the sea air&rsquo;ll
bring back her strength soon, and that ol&rsquo; Susan
Warner will pay her respects as soon as she&rsquo;s
wanted. Jenny, dearie, can you recollect all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, who had been seated on the top step of
the seaward veranda shelling peas and reading to
her best friend, had leaped up when her dear old
grandmother had appeared. Laughingly she slipped
an arm about her, when she finished speaking, and
kissed both of her cheeks. Then she peered into the
faded blue eyes that were smiling at her so fondly
as she entreated, &ldquo;Granny Sue, wouldn&rsquo;t it do as well
if I left the basket at the kitchen door and asked a
maid to give the message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman looked inquiringly into the flower-like
face so close to her own. &ldquo;Would you mind
seein&rsquo; the missus, if you was let to? I&rsquo;d powerful
well like to hear the straight of how she is, and
when she&rsquo;d like to have me pay my respects. You
aren&rsquo;t skeered of her, are you, dearie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Granny Sue. Although I must
confess I was terribly scared of her when I was
little. I thought she was an ogress. I do believe
I will put in some of our field poppies to golden up
the basket. Would she like that, Granny, do you
think? I gathered ever so many this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon she&rsquo;d be pleased, an&rsquo; if I was you. I&rsquo;d
put on that fresh yellow muslin. You look right
smart in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora was an interested listener. She had heard
all about the proud, haughty woman who was owner
of the farm, and mother of the disagreeable Gwynette
and of the nice Harold. She knew <i>he</i> must be
nice by the way all three of the Warners spoke of
him.</p>
<p>She now put in: &ldquo;O, Jenny, do wear that adorable
droopy hat with the buttercup wreath. You look
like a nymph of sunshine when you&rsquo;re all in yellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will! I live but to please.&rdquo; This
was said gaily. &ldquo;Be prepared now for a transformation
scene: from an aproned sheller of peas to a
nymph of sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fewer minutes than seemed possible, Jenny
again appeared, and spreading her fresh yellow muslin
skirt, she made a minuet curtsy. Then she asked
merrily, &ldquo;Mistress Lenora, pray tell how a nymph
of sunshine should walk and what she should say
when she calls upon the most Olympian person she
knows. Sort of a Juno.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just act natural, dearie,&rdquo; the proud grandmother
had appeared with the basket of eggs, poppies and
honey in time to reply to this query, &ldquo;and no nymphs,
whatever they be, could be sweeter or more pleasin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Then she added, &ldquo;Your grandpa&rsquo;s got Dobbin all
hitched an&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; for you. Good-bye, dearie!
Harold&rsquo;ll be glad to have you kind to his ma. He
sets a store by her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the last remark that gave Jenny courage
to ask if she might see Mrs. Poindexter-Jones,
twenty minutes later, when she had driven around
to the side door of the mansion-like stone house.
Cecile looked doubtful. &ldquo;Ef eets to give the basket,
the keetchen&rsquo;s the place for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny smiled on Cecile, and the maid found herself
staring in puzzled amazement. Who was this
girl who looked like that other one who had just
left; looked like her and yet didn&rsquo;t, for she was far
prettier and with such a kindly light in her smiling
brown eyes. &ldquo;Please tell Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
that Susan Warner, on the farm, sent me over and
would like me to deliver a message myself if she
wishes to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing for Cecile to do but carry the
message, and, to her amazement, Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
looked pleased and requested that the maid
show the girl at once to the pond-lily garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Almost shyly Jenny Warner went down the box-edged
path. The elderly lady, not vain and proud
as she had been in her younger days, lying back on
soft silken pillows, watched her coming.</p>
<p>How pretty the girl looked in her simple yellow
muslin frock, with her wide drooping hat, buttercup
wreathed, and on her arm a basket, golden with field
poppies.</p>
<p>As she neared, Mrs. Poindexter-Jones felt a mist
in her eyes, for this girl looked very like the other
only there was such a sweet, loving expression in the
responsive face, while Gwynette&rsquo;s habitual outlook
on life had made her proud, critical and cold. The
woman impulsively held out a hand. &ldquo;Jenny Warner,&rdquo;
she said as she lifted the mist-filled eyes,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you kiss me, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively Jenny knew that this invalid mother
of Harold was in real need of tenderness and love.
Unhesitatingly she kissed her, then took the seat
toward which Mrs. Poindexter-Jones motioned.
The basket she placed on the table. &ldquo;Grandmother
wished me to bring you some of our strained honey
and fresh eggs and to ask you when you would like
her to come and pay her respects.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>The woman smiled faintly. She seemed very
very tired. Thoughtfully she replied, &ldquo;Tomorrow,
at about this hour, if the day is as pleasant as this.
I will again be in the garden here. Tell Susan Warner
I very much want to see her. I want to ask her
a question.&rdquo; Then she closed her eyes and seemed
to be resting. Jenny wondered if she ought to go,
but at her first rustle the eyes were opened and the
woman smiled at the girl. &ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; she said, somewhat
wistfully, &ldquo;I want to ask your grandmother
<i>how</i> she brought you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was puzzled. Why should Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
care about the simple home life of a
family in her employ.</p>
<p>But, before she had time to wonder long, the invalid
was changing the subject. &ldquo;Jenny, do you
like to read aloud?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>There was sincere enthusiasm in the reply. &ldquo;Oh,
Mrs. Poindexter-Jones, I love to! I read aloud
every day to my dear friend Lenora Gale, who is
visiting me. We are reading poetry just now, but
I care a great deal for prose also. Books and nature
are the two things for which I care most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke Jenny glanced at the book lying on
the small table where she had placed her basket.
Almost shyly she asked. &ldquo;Were you reading this
book before I came?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My nurse, Miss Dane, was reading it to me.
She is a very kind, good woman, but her voice is
rasping, and it is hard for me to listen. My nerves
are still far from normal and I was wishing that
I had some young girl to read to me.&rdquo; Jenny at
once thought of Gwynette. Surely she would be
glad to read to her mother while she was ill. As
though she had heard the thought, the woman answered
it, and her tone was sad. &ldquo;My daughter,
unfortunately, does not like to read aloud. She does
not care for books&mdash;nor for nature&mdash;nor for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
the woman hesitated. She did not want to criticize
Gwynette before another, and so she turned and
looked with almost wistful inquiry at the girl.
&ldquo;Jenny Warner, may I engage your services to read
to me one or two hours a day if your grandmother
can spare you that long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s liquid brown eyes were aglow with
pleasure. This was Harold&rsquo;s mother for whom she
could do a real service. &ldquo;Oh, may I read to you,
Mrs. Poindexter-Jones? I would be so glad to do
something&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated and a deeper rose color
stole into her cheeks. She could not say for &ldquo;Harold&rsquo;s
mother.&rdquo; Mrs. Poindexter-Jones would not
understand the depth of the girl&rsquo;s gratitude toward
the boy who was making it possible for her dear old
grandparents to remain on the farm. And the
woman, gazing at her, found that just then she could
not mention remuneration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you come to me day after tomorrow at
ten.&rdquo; Miss Dane had appeared to say that it was
time for the invalid to go into the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it noon so soon?&rdquo; the woman inquired, then
turning back toward the girl who had risen, she
added: &ldquo;Seeing you has done me much good.
Good-bye. Tell Susan Warner I want to see her
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny returned home, her heart singing. She was
to have an opportunity to thank Harold, and she
was glad.</p>
<p>When Jenny reached the farmhouse she found
her family in the kitchen, and by the way they all
stopped talking when she entered, she was sure that
something had happened during her absence which
they had been discussing, nor was she wrong.</p>
<p>She looked from one interested face to another,
then exclaimed: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re keeping a secret from me.
What is it, please tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora, who had been made comfortable with
pillows in grandfather&rsquo;s easy chair, drawn close to
the stove, merrily replied: &ldquo;The secret is in plain
sight. You must hunt, though, and find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny whirled to look at the table, already set
with the supper things, but nothing unusual was
there; then her glance traveled to the old mahogany
cupboard, where, behind glass doors, in tidy rows,
the best china stood. There, leaning against a tumbler,
was an envelope bearing a foreign stamp.</p>
<p>With a cry of joy Jenny leaped forward. Instinctively
she seemed to know that it was the long
watched-for letter from Etta Heldt, nor was she
wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>With eager fingers the envelope was opened. A
draft fluttered to the floor. Jenny picked it up, then,
after a glance at it, turned a glowing face toward
the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; she cried joyfully. &ldquo;I knew Etta
Heldt was honest! This is every penny that she
owes us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The handwriting was difficult to read and for a
silent moment Jenny studied it, then brightly she
exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, such wonderful news!&rdquo; Then
she read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have written long ago, but my grandpa
took sick and was like to die when I got here, and
my grandma and I had to set up nights, turn about,
and days I was so tired and busy. I didn&rsquo;t forget
though. Poor grandpa died after a month, but I&rsquo;m
glad I got here first. He was more willing to go,
being as I&rsquo;d be here with grandma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I guess you&rsquo;re wondering where I got the
money I&rsquo;m sending you. I got it from Hans Heldt.
He&rsquo;s sort of relation of mine, though not close, and
he wanted me to marry him and I said no, not till
I paid the money I owed. He said he&rsquo;d give it to
me and then we&rsquo;d make it up working grandpa&rsquo;s
farm together. So we got married and here&rsquo;s the
money, and my grandma wishes to tell your grandma
how thankful she is to her and you for sending
me home to her. I guess that&rsquo;s all. Good-bye.</p>
<p class="center">Your grateful friend,</p>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Etta Heldt</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>There were tears in Jenny&rsquo;s eyes as she looked up.
&ldquo;Oh, Grandma Sue,&rdquo; she ran across the room and
clung to the dear old woman, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you glad, glad,
glad we brought so much happiness into three lives?&rdquo;
Later, when they were at supper, Jenny told about
her visit to Poindexter Arms.</p>
<p>There was a sad foreboding in the hearts of the
old couple that evening. Although they said little,
each was wondering what the outcome of their
&ldquo;gal&rsquo;s&rdquo; daily readings would be. &ldquo;Whatever &rsquo;tis,
&rsquo;twill like to be for the best, I reckon,&rdquo; was Susan
Warner&rsquo;s philosophic conclusion, and the old man&rsquo;s
customary reply, &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late yer right, Ma! Yo&rsquo; be
mos&rsquo; allays.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">REVELATIONS AND REGRETS</span></h2>
<p>Susan Warner reached Poindexter Arms at the
hour appointed and found her employer in the lily-pond
garden. The old woman curtsied. Her heart
was filled with pity. How changed was her formerly
haughty mistress. There were more lines in
the pale, patrician face than there were in the ruddy
countenance of the humbler woman who was years
the older. Hesitatingly she spoke: &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve
been mighty sick, Mis&rsquo; Poindexter-Jones. It&rsquo;s a pity,
too, you havin&rsquo; so much to make life free of care an&rsquo;
happy.&rdquo; But the sad expression in the tired eyes,
that were watching her so kindly, seemed to belie
the words of the old woman who had been nurse for
Baby Harold and housekeeper at Poindexter Arms
for many years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, Susan. Miss Dane, my nurse, has
gone to town to make a few purchases for me. Some
of them books&mdash;&rdquo; the invalid paused and turned
questioningly toward the older woman. &ldquo;Did your
Jenny tell you that I wish to engage her services for
an hour or two each morning&mdash;reading to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner nodded, saying brightly, &ldquo;She was
that pleased, Jenny was! She didn&rsquo;t tell me just
what she was meaning, but she said, happy-like, &lsquo;It
will give me a chance to pay a debt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A debt.&rdquo; The invalid was perplexed. &ldquo;Why,
Jenny Warner is in no way indebted to me.&rdquo; Then
a cold, almost hard expression crept into her eyes, as
she added, &ldquo;If Gwynette had said that, I might have
understood. But she never does. She takes all that
I give her, and is rebellious because it is not more.&rdquo;
She had been thinking aloud. Before her amazed
listener uttered a comment, if, indeed, she would
have done so, which is doubtful, the younger woman
said bitterly: &ldquo;Susan Warner, I have failed, failed
miserably as a mother. You have succeeded. That
is why I especially wished to talk with you this
morning. I want your advice.&rdquo; Then Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
did a very unusual thing for her. She
acknowledged her disappointment in her adopted
daughter to someone apart from herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s selfishness is phenomenal,&rdquo; she continued,
not without bitterness. &ldquo;She is jealous of
the least favor I show my own boy and wishes all
of our plans to be made with her pleasure as our
only consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman shook her head sympathetically.
&ldquo;Tut! tut! Mis&rsquo; Poindexter-Jones, that&rsquo;s most unfeelin&rsquo;
of her. Most!&rdquo; She had been about to say
that it was hard to believe that the two girls were
really sisters, but, fearing that the comparison might
hurt the other woman&rsquo;s feelings, she said no more.</p>
<p>The invalid, an unusual color burning in her
cheeks, sighed deeply. &ldquo;Susan Warner,&rdquo; she said,
and there was almost a break in her voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
blame the girl too much. I try not to. If you had
brought her up, and I had had Jenny, it might have
been different. They&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Susan Warner could not wait, as was her
wont for a superior to finish a sentence. She hurriedly
interrupted with &ldquo;Our Jenny wouldn&rsquo;t have
been different from what she is&mdash;no matter how she
was fetched up. I reckon she just <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> be. She&rsquo;d
have been so grateful to you for havin&rsquo; given her a
chance&mdash;she&rsquo;d have been sweeter&rsquo;n ever. Jenny
would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>The older woman was not entirely convinced. &ldquo;I
taught Gwynette to be proud,&rdquo; she said reminiscently.
&ldquo;I wanted her to select her friends from
only the best families. I was foolishly proud myself,
and now I am being punished for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner said timidly, &ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;ll change
yet. Maybe &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear it is far too late.&rdquo; The invalid again
dropped wearily back among her silken pillows. She
closed her eyes, but opened them almost at once to
turn a keenly inquiring glance at her visitor. &ldquo;Susan
Warner, I wanted to ask you this question: Do you
think it might break down Gwynette&rsquo;s selfish,
haughty pride if she were to be told that she is your
Jenny&rsquo;s sister and my adopted daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older woman looked startled. &ldquo;Oh, I reckon
I wouldn&rsquo;t be hasty about tellin&rsquo; that, Mis&rsquo; Poindexter-Jones.
I reckon I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Then she
faced the matter squarely. Perhaps the panic in her
heart had been caused by selfish reasons. If the
two girls were told that they were sisters, then Jenny
would have to know that she was not the real granddaughter
of the Warners. Would she, could she
love them as dearly after that? The old woman
rose, saying quaveringly, &ldquo;Please, may I talk it over
with Silas first. He&rsquo;s clear thinkin&rsquo;, Silas is, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;ll see the straight of it.&rdquo; And to this Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>On the day following, at the appointed hour,
Jenny Warner, again wearing her pale yellow dress,
appeared in the garden by the lily pond, and was
welcomed by the invalid with a smile that brightened
her weary face.</p>
<p>There were half a dozen new books on the small
table, and Mrs. Poindexter-Jones, without preface,
said: &ldquo;Choose which one you would like to read,
Jeanette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced quickly at the girl, rebuking herself
for having used the name of long ago, but it evidently
had been unnoticed. The truth was that Miss
Dearborn, her beloved teacher, had often used that
longer name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all look interesting. O, here is one, &lsquo;The
Morning Star.&rsquo; I do believe that is poetry in prose.
How I wish Lenora might hear it also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora?&rdquo; the woman spoke inquiringly; then
&ldquo;O, I recall now. You did say that you have a visitor
who is ill. Is she strong enough to accompany
you to my garden for our readings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would be, I think. The doctor said that by
tomorrow I might take her for a drive. I could
bring her chair and her cushions.&rdquo; But the older
woman interrupted. &ldquo;No need to do that Jeanette.
I have many pillows and several reclining chairs.&rdquo;
Then she suggested: &ldquo;Suppose we leave the book
until your friend is with us. There is a collection
of short stories that will do for today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Jenny Warner read well. Miss Dearborn had
seen to that, as she considered reading aloud an
accomplishment to be cultivated.</p>
<p>The invalid was charmed. The girl&rsquo;s voice was
musical, soft yet clear, and most soothing to the
harassed nerves of the woman, broken by the endless
round of society&rsquo;s demands.</p>
<p>When the one story was finished, the woman said:
&ldquo;Close the book, please, Jeanette. I would rather
talk. I want to hear all about yourself, what you
do, who are your friends, and what are your plans
for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny Warner told first of all about Miss Dearborn.
That story was very enlightening to the
listener. She had felt that some influence, other
than that of the Warners, must have helped in the
moulding of the girl who sat before her. &ldquo;I would
like to meet Miss Dearborn,&rdquo; was her only comment.</p>
<p>Then Jenny told about Lenora Gale and the
brother, Charles, who was coming to take her back
to Dakota.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lenora will not be strong enough to travel,
perhaps not for a month, the doctor thinks. I do
not know what her brother will do, but Lenora will
remain with me.&rdquo; Such a glad light was shining in
the liquid brown eyes that the older woman was
moved to say, &ldquo;It makes you very happy to have a
girl companion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Jenny clasped her hands, as she exclaimed: &ldquo;No
one knows how I have always longed to have a
sister. I have never had friends&mdash;girl friends, I
mean&mdash;I have been Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s only pupil, but
often and often I have pretended that I had a sister
about my own age. I would wake up in the night,
the way girls do in books, and confide my secrets to
a make-believe sister. Then, when I went on long
tramps alone up in the foothills, I pretended that
my sister was with me and we made plans together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl hesitated and glanced at her listener,
suddenly abashed, fearing that the older woman
would think her prattling foolish. She was amazed
at the changed expression. Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
was ashen gray and her face was drawn as though
she were suffering. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said faintly, &ldquo;call
Miss Dane, please! I would like to go in. It was
a great wrong, a very great wrong&mdash;and yet, every
one meant well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puzzled, indeed, the girl arose and hastened
toward the house. Mrs. Poindexter-Jones must
have become worse, and suddenly she was even wandering
in her mind. Jenny found the nurse not far
away lying in a hammock, just resting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>She hurried to her patient. The woman leaned
heavily on her companion as she walked toward the
house. The girl, fearing that her chattering had
overtired Harold&rsquo;s mother, followed penitently.</p>
<p>At the steps the woman turned and held out a
frail hand. There were tears on her cheeks and in
her eyes. &ldquo;Jeanette,&rdquo; she said, almost feebly, &ldquo;I am
very tired. Do not come again until I send for you.
I want to think. I must decide what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, noting the unhappy expression on the sweet
face of the girl, she said, ever so tenderly, &ldquo;You
have not tired me, dear, dear Jeanette. Don&rsquo;t think
that. It is something very different.&rdquo; Puzzled and
troubled, Jenny returned to the farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">MOTHER AND SON</span></h2>
<p>The news from the big house on the day following
was that Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had had a relapse
and was again very weak and ill. The same
doctor who visited Lenora was the physician at
Poindexter Arms. The son, Harold, had been sent
for, and, as his examinations at the military academy
were over, he would not return. That, the
doctor confided to Susan Warner, was indeed fortunate,
as his patient had longed to see her boy.
&ldquo;The most curious thing about it all,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;is that she has not sent for her daughter, who is
so near that she could reach her mother&rsquo;s bedside in
half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had said. &ldquo;I
wish to talk with my son. He will know what is
best to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Harold, arrived and went at once to his mother&rsquo;s
room. With infinite tenderness they greeted each
other. &ldquo;My dearest mother,&rdquo; the lad&rsquo;s tone expressed
deep concern, &ldquo;I was so happy when your
nurse wrote that you were rapidly recovering. What
has happened to cause the relapse? Have you been
overdoing? Now that I am home, mother, I want
you to lean on me in every way. Just rest, dearest,
and let whatever burdens there are be on my broad
shoulders.&rdquo; With joy and pride the sick woman
gazed at her boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know not what you
ask. The cause of my relapse is a mental one. I
have done a great wrong to two people, a very great
wrong, and it is too late to right it. No, I am not
delirious.&rdquo; She smiled up into his troubled, anxious
face and her eyes were clear, even though unusually
bright.</p>
<p>Then the nurse glided in to protest that Mrs.
Poindexter-Jones would better rest before talking
more with her son. But the sick woman was obstinate.
&ldquo;Miss Dane,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please let me do as
I wish in this matter. I will take the responsibility
with the doctor. I want to be alone with my boy
for fifteen minutes. Then he will go away and you
may come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse could do nothing but retire, though
much against her better judgment. Harold seated
himself close to the bed and held one of his mother&rsquo;s
hands in his cool, firm clasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dearest?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What is
troubling you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Then she told the story, the whole of it, not
sparing her own wrong training of the girl, concluding
with her disappointment in her adopted
daughter. The lad leaned over and kissed his mother
tenderly. &ldquo;You meant so kindly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when
you took an orphan into your home and gave her
every opportunity to make good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated and the woman asked: &ldquo;Harold, did
you know? Did you ever guess? You do not seem
surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest. Long ago. Not just at first, of
course, for I was only five when Gwynette came into
our home and she was three, but later, when I was
grown, I knew that she was not my own little sister,
or she would have come to us as a wee baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I might have known that you would
reason it out when you were older. I wish now that
you had spoken to me about it, then I could have
asked your advice sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear lad. It is often very helpful to talk
a problem over with someone whose point of view
naturally would be different. You might have saved
me from many mistakes. What I wish to ask now
is this: If I can obtain the permission of the Warners
(we made an agreement long years ago that
the secret was never to be revealed by any of us),
but if now they think it might be best, would you
advise me to tell Gwynette the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>The lad looked thoughtfully out of the window
near. His mother waited eagerly. She had decided
to abide by his advice whatever it might be. At last
he turned toward her. &ldquo;Knowing Gwynette&rsquo;s supreme
selfishness, I fear that whatever love she may
have for you, mother, would be turned to very bitter
hatred. She would feel that you were hurling her
from a class, of which she is snobbishly proud, down
into one that she considers very little better than
serfdom. I hardly know how she would take it.
She might do something desperate.&rdquo; The boy regretted
these words as soon as they were spoken.
The woman&rsquo;s eyes were startled and because of her
great weakness she began to shiver as though in a
chill. The repentant lad knelt and held her close.
&ldquo;Mother, dear, leave it all to me, will you? Forget
it and just get well for my sake.&rdquo; Then with a
break in his voice, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to live without
<i>you</i>, dearest.&rdquo; A sweet calm stole into the woman&rsquo;s
soul. Nothing else seemed to matter. She rested
her cheek against her son&rsquo;s head as she said softly:
&ldquo;My boy! For your sake I will get well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Harold, upon leaving his mother, went at once to
his room, and, throwing himself down in his comfortable
morris-chair, with his hands thrust deep
into his trouser pockets, he sat staring out of a wide
picture-window. He did not notice, however, the
white-capped waves on the tossing, restless sea. He
was remembering all that had happened from his
little boyhood, especially all that associated him
with the girl he had long realized could not be his
own sister.</p>
<p>Had he been to her the companion that he might
have been, indeed that he should have been, even
though he knew she was not his father&rsquo;s child? No,
he had really never cared for her and he had avoided
her companionship whenever it was possible. Many
a time he had known that she was hurt at his lack
of devotion. Only recently, when he had so much
preferred taking Sunday dinner at the farm, and
had actually forgotten Gwyn until the haughty girl
had reminded him that it was his duty to take her
wherever she would like to dine, he had recalled,
almost too late, that it would be his mother&rsquo;s wish,
and now, that his father was gone, his mother was
the one person whom he loved above all others. His
conclusion, after half an hour of relentless self-examination,
was that he was very much to blame
for Gwynette&rsquo;s selfishness. If he had long ago
sought her confidence, long ago in the formative
years, they might have grown up in loving companionship
as a sister and brother should. This,
surely, would have happened, a thought tried to
excuse him to himself, if she had been an own sister.
But he looked at it squarely. &ldquo;If my mother wanted
Gwynette enough to adopt her and have her share
in all things with her own son, that son should have
accepted her as a sister.&rdquo; Rising, he walked to the
window, and, for a few moments, he really saw the
wind-swept sea. Then, whirling on his heel, he
snapped his fingers as he thought with a new determination.
&ldquo;I shall ask our mother (he purposely
said &lsquo;our&rsquo;) to give me a fortnight to help Gwyn
change her point of view, before the revelation is
made to her. The fault, I can see now, has not been
wholly her own. Mother has shown in a thousand
ways that I am the one she really loves. Not that
she has neglected Gwyn, but there has been a difference.&rdquo;
He was putting on his topcoat and cap as he
made the decision to take a run up to the seminary
and see how his sister was getting on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>As he neared his mother&rsquo;s room, the nurse appeared,
closing the door behind her so softly that
the lad knew, without asking, that the invalid was
asleep. Miss Dane smiled at the comely youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My patient is much better since you came home.
I believe you were the tonic, or the narcotic rather,
that she needed, for she seems soothed and quieted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad&rsquo;s brightening expression told the nurse
how great was his love for his mother. She went
her way to the kitchen to prepare a strengthening
broth for the invalid to be given her when she should
awaken, and all the while she was wondering why
a son should be so devoted and a daughter seem to
care so little. It was evident to the most casual
observer that Gwynette cared for no one but herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Harold was soon in his little gray speedster and
out on the highway. He thought that, first of all,
he would dart into town and buy a box of Gwyn&rsquo;s
favorite chocolates. She could not but greet him
graciously when he appeared with a gift for her.
On the coast highway, near Santa Barbara, there
was a roadside inn where motoring parties lunched
and where the best of candies could be procured.
As he was about to complete his purchase, a tall,
broad-shouldered young man, with the build of a
college athlete, entered carrying a suitcase. He inquired
when the next bus would pass that way, and,
finding that he would have to wait at least an hour,
he next asked how far it was to the farm of Silas
Warner. Harold stepped forward, before the clerk
could reply, and said, &ldquo;I am going in that direction.
In fact I shall pass the farm. May I give you a
lift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they left the shop and were soon speeding
along the highway, neither dreaming of all that
this meeting was to mean to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">HAROLD AND CHARLES</span></h2>
<p>Harold was frankly curious. He had not heard
of the guest at the Warner&rsquo;s. Indeed, having arrived
but that day he had heard nothing except his
mother&rsquo;s anxiety about Gwynette. Could it be possible
that the fine-looking chap at his side was a
friend of Jenny&rsquo;s? He could easily understand that
anyone, man or woman, who had once met her
would, ever after, wish to be counted as one of
her friends.</p>
<p>When they were well out in the country, the lad
at the wheel turned and smiled in his frank, friendly
way. &ldquo;Stranger hereabouts?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; the young man replied. &ldquo;This is
my third visit, though the other two could hardly
be called that. I came here when the rainy season
began up north to put my sister, who is not strong,
in the seminary here. I hoped that your more even
climate might help restore her strength. Dakota is
our home state. We have a ranch there, but the
winters are very severe. Sister, I am sorry to say,
was not happy at the seminary, and, when she did
take a severe cold, she did not recover, and so I
made my second flying trip with the intention of
taking her to Arizona if that seemed best, but, when
I arrived her nurse told me that she believed a
pleasant home atmosphere would do more for my
sister than a dry air. This, I was glad to find, had
already been offered to Lenora. She had met a girl,
Jenny Warner is her name, and the two had become
fast friends. On the very day that I arrived Miss
Jenny was also going to the seminary with an invitation
from her grandmother which was to make my
sister a guest in their home until she should be
strong enough to travel. That was two weeks ago.
This, my third visit, is for the purpose of determining
if Lenora is well enough to accompany me to
our home in Dakota. My name is Charles Gale,
and I have just completed the agricultural course
connected with the state college at Berkeley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold reached out a strong brown hand which
was grasped heartily by another equally strong and
brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great! I&rsquo;d like well to take that course. Harold
Jones is my name. Mother and Sis put a Poindexter
and a hyphen in the middle. Women like that sort
of thing. It was mother&rsquo;s maiden name. Well, here
we are at the long lane that leads up to the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles leaned over to pick up his suitcase.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn in. I can hike up to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo; Harold swung into the narrow
dirt lane. &ldquo;I was planning to pay a visit to
Susan Warner. She took care of me when I was
a small kid, you see, and so I claim her as sort of a
foster grandmother, and, as for Silas Warner,
there&rsquo;s no finer example of the old school farmer
living, or I miss my bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles looked interested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet him.
I was here such a short time on my last visit that,
although I met Mrs. Warner, I did not see her good
spouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold, eager to create some sort of a stir, caused
his sport siren to announce their arrival with shrill
staccato notes. It had the desired effect. First of
all dear old Susan Warner bustled out of the kitchen
door, then from around the front corner of the house
came Jenny with her friend, frail and white, leaning
on her arm. Lenora&rsquo;s face brightened when she
saw her brother and she held out both arms to him
as he leaped from the low car. Harold chivalrously
sprang up on the side porch to shake hands first of
all with his one time nurse, then he went to Jenny,
and although he did not really frame his thought in
words, he was conscious of feeling glad that it was
<i>his</i> arrival and not that of Charles Gale which was
causing her liquid brown eyes to glow with a welcome
which, at least, was most friendly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, all of you, do, and have a glass of milk
and a cookie.&rdquo; Grandma Sue thought of them as
just big children, and, by the eagerness with which
they accepted the invitation, she was evidently not
far wrong.</p>
<p>Jenny skipped to the cooling cellar to soon return
with a blue crockery pitcher brimming with creamy
milk. Susan Warner heaped a plate with cookies.
Charles led his sister to Grandpa Si&rsquo;s comfortable
armed chair near the stove. When they were all
seated and partaking of the refreshments, the older
of the lads said, &ldquo;Sister, you are not yet strong
enough to travel, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I think that I am! We could have a drawing
room all of the way and I could lie down most of
the time.&rdquo; But even the excitement of her brother&rsquo;s
arrival had tired her.</p>
<p>Jenny went to her friend&rsquo;s side and, sitting on the
broad arm of the chair, she pleaded: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave
me so soon, Lenora! Aren&rsquo;t you happy here with us?
You&rsquo;ve been getting stronger every day, and only
yesterday Grandma Sue told the doctor that she
hoped you would be here another fortnight, and he
said, didn&rsquo;t he, Grandma Sue, that it would be at
least that long before you would be able to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Lenora looked anxiously at her brother. She
knew that he was eager to get back to their Dakota
ranch home, knowing that their father needed him
and was lonely for both of them. But the young
man said at once, &ldquo;I believe the doctor is right. I
will wire Dad tonight when I go back to the hotel
that we will remain two weeks longer.&rdquo; Then,
turning toward the nodding, smiling old woman, he
asked: &ldquo;Mrs. Warner, you are quite sure that we
are not imposing upon you? I could take my sister
with me if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner&rsquo;s reply was sincerely given. &ldquo;Mr.
Gale,&rdquo; she said, her ruddy face beaming, &ldquo;I reckon
there&rsquo;s three of us in this old farmhouse as wishes
your sister Lenora was goin&rsquo; to stay all summer.
Jenny, here,&rdquo; how fondly the faded blue eyes turned
toward her girl, &ldquo;has allays had a hankering for an
own sister, and since it&rsquo;s too late now for that, next
best is to adopt one, and Lenora is her choice and
mine, too, and Si&rsquo;s as well, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s relief and appreciation were
warmly expressed. Then he said, &ldquo;Father will want
us to stay under the circumstances. I will remain at
the hotel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Grandma Sue interrupted with, &ldquo;I
do wish we had another bedroom here. It&rsquo;s a powerful
way from the farm to town and Lenora will want
to see you every day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Harold had been thoughtfully gazing at the floor.
He now spoke. &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; then with his half whimsical,
wholly friendly smile he digressed, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t
mind if I call you that, will you, since we are merely
boys of a larger growth,&rdquo; then continued with,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t decide where you will bunk, please, until
I have had an opportunity to talk the matter over
with my invalid mother. I&rsquo;d like bully well to have
you for my guest. I have a plan, a keen one if I can
carry it out. I&rsquo;ll not reveal it until I know.&rdquo; Harold
stood up, suddenly recalling that he had a duty to
fulfill which was being neglected for his own pleasure.
That had always been his way, he feared, when
he had to choose between Gwynette and someone
who really interested him.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Warner he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way over
to the seminary to see my sister. Poor kid! There
are two more days of prison life for her, or so she
considers it. Mother requested that she remain at
the seminary until the term is over and it&rsquo;s being
hard for her.&rdquo; Then to the taller lad, &ldquo;Charles, you
want to stay here with your sister until evening anyway,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl quickly put out a detaining hand, as she
said, &ldquo;O please do stay. I haven&rsquo;t asked you a single
question yet. It will take you until dark to answer
half that I want to know.&rdquo; The big brown hand
closed over the frail one. To Harold he replied,
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be here if I can get a bus to town in the
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need the bus, not if my little gray bug
is in working order.&rdquo; They had all risen except
Lenora, and Susan Warner said hospitably, &ldquo;Harry-lad,
if your ma don&rsquo;t need you over to the big house,
come back in time for supper. I&rsquo;ll make the corn
bread you set such a store by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll be here with bells,&rdquo; the lad called as
he leaped into his waiting car.</p>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">A JOLLY PLAN</span></h2>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s little gray &ldquo;bug,&rdquo; as he sometimes
called the car which he boasted was the speediest of
its kind, made the long upgrade in high, and that,
being a feat it had not accomplished on its last
ascent, so gratified the youthful owner that he swung
into the seminary grounds with a flourish. Upon
seeing his sister sitting moodily in the summer-house
with a novel, unread, on her knee, he ran in that
direction, waving his cap gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there, Sis!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Get on your bonnet
and come for a ride. The bug is outdoing itself
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, whose eyes were suspiciously red, turned
toward him coldly. &ldquo;Harold, how many times have
I asked you not to call me Sis. It savors of kitchen
mechanics, and, what is more, I do not wear a bonnet.
Finally, I most certainly do not wish to ride
in that racer of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>The boy dropped down on the bench on the
opposite side of the summer-house and gave a long
whistle which equally aggravated his companion.
Then, stretching out to be comfortable, he thrust
his hands deep into his pockets, as he inquired:
&ldquo;Well, then, Sister Gwynette, will you enlighten me
as to why your marblesque brow is darkly clouded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s frown deepened and she turned away
from him petulantly. &ldquo;You know just as well as
I do that you care nothing whatever about my
troubles,&rdquo; she flung at him. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be here
now if Mother hadn&rsquo;t sent you, and I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t
see why she did. She cares no more for me than
you do, or she would not force me to stay in this
prison until the close of the term just for appearance
sake. I&rsquo;m not taking the final tests, so why
should I pretend that I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy drew himself upright and, leaning on the
rustic table which was between them, he said, trying
not to let his indignation sound in his voice: &ldquo;Gwynette,
do you know that our mother is very, very ill?
She is again in bed and I could only be with her for
a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Harold paused, hoping that his announcement
would cause his listener some evident concern, but
there was no change in her expression, and so more
coldly he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother said nothing whatever about her reason
for asking you to remain here until the term is over,
but it is my private opinion that when she did send
for you, some sort of a scene was stirred up which
made Mother&rsquo;s fever worse. The nurse probably
thought best for Mums to be undisturbed as long as
possible.&rdquo; Suddenly the lad sprang up, rounded the
table and sat on the side toward which his petulant
sister was facing. Impulsively he took her hand as
he asked, not unkindly, &ldquo;Gwyn, don&rsquo;t you care at
all whether our mother lives or dies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden, startled expression in the
girl&rsquo;s tear-filled eyes, but, as the lad knew, the tears
were there merely because of self-pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dies?&rdquo; she repeated rather blankly. No one
whom she had ever known had died, and she had
seemed to think that those near her were immune.
&ldquo;Is Ma Mere going to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy followed up what he believed to be an
advantage by saying gently, &ldquo;We would be all alone
in the world, Gwyn, if our mother left us, and, oh,
it would be so lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Suddenly and most unexpectedly the girl put her
arms on the table and, burying her head upon them,
she sobbed bitterly. Harold was moved to unusual
tenderness. He put his arm lovingly about his sister
as he hastened to say, reassuringly, &ldquo;Miss Dane, the
nurse, told me this morning that Mother&rsquo;s one
chance of recovery lay in not being excited in any
way. Her fever must be kept down. We&rsquo;ll help,
won&rsquo;t we, Gwyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat up and wiped her eyes with her
dainty handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; she said dully. The boy, watching
her, could not tell what emotion had caused the
outburst of grief. He decided not to follow it up,
but to permit whatever seeds had been sown to
sprout as they would.</p>
<p>Springing up, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Snapping turtles!
I forgot something I brought for you. It&rsquo;s in the
car.&rdquo; He ran back, found the box of choice candies,
returned and presented them. Gwyn was still gazing
absently ahead of her. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said, but
without evidence of pleasure.</p>
<p>The boy stood in the vine-hung doorway gazing
down at her. &ldquo;Gwyn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you want to
come home, I&rsquo;ll be over after you tomorrow. Just
say the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer to wait until my mother sends for me,&rdquo;
was the cold answer. The lad went away, fearing
that he had accomplished little.</p>
<p>It was five-thirty when the &ldquo;bug&rdquo; again turned
into the long lane that led to the farmhouse near
Rocky Point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Harold,&rdquo; Jenny turned from the
window to inform the other occupants of the
kitchen. Grandma Sue was opening the oven to
test her corn bread. Lenora was again in the comfortable
armchair near the stove. For the past hour
she had been asleep in the hammock out in the sun,
and she felt stronger and really hungry. Charles,
having been told that there was nothing that he
could do to help, sat on the bench answering the
questions his sister now and then asked.</p>
<p>Grandpa Si had not yet returned from a neighbor&rsquo;s
where he had gone to help repair fences.</p>
<p>Jenny, dressed in her white Swiss with the pink
dots, had a pink butterfly bow in her hair. Her
cheeks were flushed and her liquid brown eyes glowing.
She was wonderfully happy. Her dear friend
Lenora was to remain with her another two weeks.
She was convinced that this was the sole reason for
her joy. It did not remotely enter her thought that
perhaps the return of Harold might be adding to her
happiness.</p>
<p>Charles, hearing the siren call, leaped to the porch
and the boys again shook hands like old friends who
had not met in many a day.</p>
<p>Harold was plainly elated. He detained Charles
on the porch long enough to tell his plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over to see Mother since I left and she
is quite willing that I open up the little cabin on the
cliff that used to belong to my Dad when he was
young. It&rsquo;s been closed since he died and I didn&rsquo;t
know how Mother would feel about having it occupied.
But when she heard about you, she said she
was glad indeed that I was to have a companion, as
she knew the big house would seem lonely while she
is ill, so we&rsquo;ll move right over there after supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; the Dakota boy was equally
pleased. &ldquo;Honest, I&rsquo;ll confess it now; I did dread
going to that barren Commercial Hotel, and I
couldn&rsquo;t afford to spend more than ten minutes at
The Palms, not if I had to pay for the privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s tell our good news.&rdquo; Harold led
the way into the kitchen where his jubilant enthusiasm
was met with a like response. Lenora clapped
her hands. &ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t you two boys have the nicest
time! Tell us about that cabin. How did your
father happen to build it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I ever really knew. Gwyn and
I were such little things when he died.&rdquo; Turning to
the older woman, who had dropped on the bench
to rest, he asked, &ldquo;Grandma Sue, you, of course,
know all that happened. You were living near here,
weren&rsquo;t you, when my father was a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I was. My folks had the overseein&rsquo; of
a lemon grove up Live Oak Canyon way. First off
I did fine sewin&rsquo; for your Grandma Jones. That&rsquo;s
how I come to know your family so well. But she
didn&rsquo;t live long arter I went there, and your grandpa
was so broke up, he went to pieces sort of, right
arter the funeral an&rsquo; pined away, slow like, for two
years about. Your pa, Harry, was the only child,
and he give up his lawin&rsquo; in the big city and come
home to stay and be company for his pa. I never
saw two folks set a greater store by each other, but
the old man (your grandpa wasn&rsquo;t really old, but
grievin&rsquo; aged him), even his boy seemed like couldn&rsquo;t
cheer him up, he missed his good woman so. &rsquo;Twant
long afore he followed her into the great beyond.
That other Harold, your pa, was only twenty-two
or thereabouts and he was all broke up. He didn&rsquo;t
seem to want to go back to the lawin&rsquo; and it was too
lonesome for him to stay in the big house, so he sent
the help all away, giving &rsquo;em each a present of three
months&rsquo; pay. That is, he sent &rsquo;em all but Sing Long.
Sing was a young Chinaman then, and he wanted to
stay with your pa. That&rsquo;s when he had the cabin
on the cliff built. He was allays readin&rsquo;, your pa
was, so he filled one big room with books and with
Sing Long to cook for him and take care of him,
there he stayed until he was twenty-five. Then he
went &rsquo;round the world and came back with a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Grandpa Si&rsquo;s entrance interrupted the story. The
old man was surprised to find company in the
kitchen. &ldquo;Wall, wall, I swan to glory!&rdquo; He took
off his straw hat and rubbed his forehead with his
big red bandanna handkerchief. &ldquo;If &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t my helper
come so soon. Harry-lad, it&rsquo;s good for sore eyes to
see you lookin&rsquo; so young, like there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no sech
thing ahead as old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold shook hands heartily as he exclaimed with
his usual enthusiasm: &ldquo;Old age! Indeed, sir, I don&rsquo;t
believe in it. All I have to do is to look at you and
Grandma Sue to know that it doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; Then
turning toward the young visitor, he continued:
&ldquo;Silas Warner, may I make you acquainted with
Charles Gale?&rdquo; The weather-bronzed face wrinkled
into even a wider smile as the old man held a hand
toward the young stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, now, you&rsquo;re a size bigger&rsquo;n our little
Lenora here, ain&rsquo;t you? Tut, tut. We&rsquo;ve allays
boasted about how big we can grow things down
here in Californy, but I reckon Dakota&rsquo;s got us
plumb beat. Harry, you&rsquo;ll have to eat a lot to catch
up with your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That youth laughingly replied that he was afraid
that eating a lot would make him grow round instead
of high. The old man good naturedly commented,
&ldquo;Wall, Harry-lad, you ain&rsquo;t so much behind
or below whichever &rsquo;tis, not more&rsquo;n half a head, an&rsquo;
you may make that up. Though &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t short you
be now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Then he began to sniff, beaming at his spouse,
whose cheeks, from the heat of baking, were as
ruddy as winter apples. &ldquo;Ma,&rdquo; he said, wagging
his head from side to side and smacking his lips in
anticipation, &ldquo;that there smell oozin&rsquo; out of the oven
sort of hits the empty spot. Cream gravy on that
thick yellar cornmeal bread! Wall, boys, if there&rsquo;s
rich folks with finer feed &rsquo;n that I dunno what &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was washing at the sink pump as he talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; Harold agreed as he sprang to
help Jenny place the chairs around the table. Their
eyes met and Harold found himself remembering
that this lovely girl was own sister to his adopted
sister. What relation then was he to Jenny? But
before this problem could be solved, Grandma Sue
was placing the two plates of cornbread on the table
and Jenny had skipped to the stove to pour the
steaming gravy into its pitcher-like bowl.</p>
<p>Charles led Lenora to her place, although she
protested that she really could walk alone. Harold
leaped to the head to draw Grandma Sue&rsquo;s chair out,
and then Jenny&rsquo;s, while Charles did the same for
his sister. Then the merry meal began. Grandpa Si
told all that had happened during the day to Susan,
as was his custom. Never an evening meal was
begun without that query, &ldquo;Wall, Si, what happened
today. Anythin&rsquo; newsy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter how unimportant the event, if it
interested the old man enough to tell it, he was sure
of an interested listener. Indeed, two, for Jenny
having been brought up to this evening program,
was as eager as her grandmother to hear the chronicalings
of the day, which seldom held an event that
a city dweller would consider worth the recounting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I dunno as there&rsquo;s much, &rsquo;cept Pete says
the lemon crop over on that ranch whar you lived
when you was a gal, Ma, is outdoin&rsquo; itself this year.
Tryin&rsquo; to break its own record, Pete takes it. He&rsquo;s
workin&rsquo; over thar mornin&rsquo;s and loafin&rsquo; arternoons,
lest be he can pick up odd jobs like fence-mendin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Then, when the generous slices of corn bread had
been served and were covered with the delicious
cream gravy, there was not one among them who
did not do justice to it and consider it a rare treat.
After the first edge of hunger was appeased, the old
man asked what kind of a year ranchers were having
in Dakota. This answered, he smiled toward
the frail girl. &ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yo&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t plannin&rsquo;
to pull out &rsquo;f here soon, air yo&rsquo;? It&rsquo;ll be powerful
lonely for Jenny-gal, her havin&rsquo; sort of got used
to havin&rsquo; a sister.&rdquo; Then, turning to the smiling
Charles, the old man said facetiously: &ldquo;Ma an&rsquo; me
sort o&rsquo; wish you an&rsquo; your Pa didn&rsquo;t want Lenora.
We&rsquo;d like to keep her steady. Wouldn&rsquo;t we, Ma?&rdquo;
The old woman nodded, &ldquo;I reckon we would, but
there&rsquo;s others have the first right an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be thankful
for two weeks more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Directly after supper Harold said to his hostess:
&ldquo;Please forgive us if we eat and run. I want to
move into the cabin before dark.&rdquo; Then, to the old
man: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready to start work early in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">A RUSTIC CABIN</span></h2>
<p>It was just before sunset when the two boys
reached the cabin on the cliff close to the high hedge
which separated the farm from the rest of the estate.
It was a rustic affair with wide verandas on three
sides. From the long front windows there was an
unobstructed view of the coast line circling toward
the Rincon Mountain which extended peninsula-wise
out into the ocean.</p>
<p>Sing Long opened the front door and beamed at
them. He greeted Harold and his friend, saying
good naturedly, &ldquo;Me showee. Alle done.&rdquo; He led
the way at once upstairs. A very large bedroom
was most comfortably furnished with severe simplicity.
The Chinaman opened a closet door and
showed Harold his clothes hanging there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; the boy was indeed pleased to find that
he was being so well cared for. &ldquo;You may sleep up
at the big house, just as you have been doing, Sing,&rdquo;
Harold told him, &ldquo;but be back to prepare our breakfast
by five tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinaman grinned, showing spaces between
yellowed teeth. &ldquo;Belly early, him. Fibe &rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
It was quite evident that he was recalling former
days when it had been hard to awaken his young
master at a much later hour.</p>
<p>Harold laughed. &ldquo;Oh, times have changed, Sing.
No more late sleeping for me. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going
to begin to be a farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could hear the Chinaman chuckling as
though greatly amused until he was out of the cabin.
Harold at once became the thoughtful host. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
budge my things along and make room for yours in
the closet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have your trunk brought
over from The Commercial tomorrow.&rdquo; Then, going
to the window, he stood, hands thrust in pockets,
looking out at the surf plunging against the rocks.
For some moments he was deep in thought. Silently
Charles unpacked the few things he had with him.
Harold turned as the twilight crept into the room.
&ldquo;Dear old Dad loved this place,&rdquo; he said, which
showed of what he had been thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even after he and Mother were married, when
there was a crowd of gay folk up at the big house,
one of Mother&rsquo;s week-ends, Dad would come here
and stay with his books for company most of the
time. I suppose the guests thought him queer. I&rsquo;m
inclined to think that at first Mother did not understand,
for she has often told me how deeply she
regrets that she had persuaded him to give up coming
down here. She wishes that instead she had
given up the house parties. Oh, well, there&rsquo;s a lot
to regret in this old world.&rdquo; Charles, knowing
nothing of his new friend&rsquo;s self-reproach because of
having neglected his adopted sister, wondered at a
remark so unlike the enthusiastic conversation of
the earlier evening. The truth was that Harold was
saddened by this first visit to his father&rsquo;s cabin. Suddenly
he clapped a friendly hand on the older lad&rsquo;s
shoulder and said, &ldquo;But come, the prize room is
downstairs. I don&rsquo;t wonder Dad liked to be in it
more than in any room over at the big house. I used
to visit him when I was a little shaver, but the place
has been locked since his death. I was ten when
Dad died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had descended a circling open stairway
which led directly into the large room, a fleeting
glance at which Charles had had on their entering.</p>
<p>It was indeed an ideal den for a man who loved to
read. A great stone fireplace was at one end with
bookcases ceiling high, on either side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>There were Indian rugs on the floor, low wall
lamps that hung over comfortable wicker chairs
with basket-like magazine holders at the side. A
wide divan in front of the blazing fire on the hearth
invited Charles, and he threw himself full length,
his hands clasped under his head. &ldquo;Harold, this is
great,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in such a mad rush
these last days getting the finals over, packing and
traveling down here, that it seems mighty good to
stretch out and let go for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you smoke?&rdquo; Harold asked. &ldquo;If you want
to, go ahead. I never learned. Dad was much
opposed to smoking and even though I was so young
I promised I wouldn&rsquo;t, at least not until I was
twenty-one.&rdquo; Then, after a moment of thought,
the younger lad concluded: &ldquo;In memory of Dad,
I shall never begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it, old man! If a chap doesn&rsquo;t
start a bad habit, he won&rsquo;t have to struggle to break
it when it begins to pull down his health. I much
prefer to breathe fresh air myself.&rdquo; Charles changed
the subject. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about getting up at five
o&rsquo;clock to start in being a farmer? Don&rsquo;t tell me,
though, if you&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no secret to it. Sort of thought I&rsquo;d
like to learn how to run a farm since I am to own
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely! But I didn&rsquo;t know you were to inherit
a farm. Where&rsquo;s it located?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>It was evident that Charles did not know that the
Rocky Point farm belonged to Harold&rsquo;s mother and
the boy hesitated to tell, not knowing but that the
older lad would think less of the Warners and Jenny
if he knew that they were what Gwyn called his
&ldquo;mother&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo; A second thought assured him
that this would be very unlikely.</p>
<p>Simply Harold said, &ldquo;Silas Warner is my mother&rsquo;s
overseer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, I understand. You&rsquo;re lucky to have such
a splendid man to look after your interests.&rdquo; Then,
&ldquo;I like ranching mighty well. Dad suggested that I
take up law, thought I might need it later, when&mdash;&rdquo;
Charles never finished that sentence, and, if Harold
thought it queer, he made no comment.</p>
<p>They talked of college, of ambitions and plans for
the future, until bed time. For the first time in his
life Charles was lulled to sleep by the rhythmic
breaking of the waves as the tide went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">FUN AS FARMERS</span></h2>
<p>Grandpa Si and Grandma Sue were alone at a
five o&rsquo;clock breakfast. They did not wish Jenny to
get up that early as there was really nothing to do,
but make the morning coffee, fry the bacon and flapjacks,
which constituted the farmer&rsquo;s breakfast menu
every day in the year.</p>
<p>Silas Warner often tried to persuade his good
wife to sleep later, telling her that he could well
enough prepare his own breakfast, but he had long
since desisted, realizing that he would be depriving
her of one of their happiest hours together. It was
then, when they were quite alone, that they talked
over many things, and this morning Susan found
her hands trembling as she poured the golden brown
coffee into her husband&rsquo;s large thick china cup. Silas
had asked for three days to meditate on the serious
question of whether or not they should tell Jenny
that she was not their own child, and Susan well
knew that this morning she would hear his decision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>It was not until the cakes were fried and she was
seated opposite him that he looked over at her with
his most genial smile, and yet the silent watcher
knew him so well that she could sense that he was
not happy in the decision which he evidently had
reached. &ldquo;Pa, you think it&rsquo;s best to tell, don&rsquo;t you?
I can sort o&rsquo; see it comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s about what my ruminatin&rsquo; fetched
me to, Susan. You&rsquo;n me know how our gal&rsquo;s hankerin&rsquo;
for an own sister, and now that Lenora is goin&rsquo;,
she&rsquo;ll be lorner &rsquo;n ever, Jenny will.&rdquo; He glanced
toward the closed door which led to the living room
where their &ldquo;gal&rdquo; slept since she had given her bed
to her guest. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d better keep it dark
though till Lenora&rsquo;s gone, then sort of feel our way
as how best to tell it. Thar&rsquo;s time enough. While
Lenora&rsquo;s here, there ain&rsquo;t no need for any other
sister for our gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner sighed, even while she smiled
waveringly. &ldquo;Wall, Si, if you think it&rsquo;s best, I
reckon &rsquo;tis. But it&rsquo;ll be powerful hard to have Jenny
thinkin&rsquo; the less of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good man rose and walked around the table
and placed a big gnarled hand on his wife&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Tut! Tut! Susy,&rdquo; that was the name he had used
in the courtin&rsquo; days, &ldquo;our gal ain&rsquo;t made of no sech
clay as that. She&rsquo;ll stick by us all the tighter, you
see if &rsquo;taint so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Further conversation on the subject was prevented
by the arrival of Harold and Charles decked
in overalls, which the former lad had obtained from
his mother&rsquo;s gardener.</p>
<p>Silas Warner stepped out on the side porch to
greet them and his grin was at its widest. &ldquo;Wall,
I swan to glory, if here ain&rsquo;t my two helpers. Ready
to milk the cow, Harry-lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Warner appeared in the open door, her blue
checked apron wound about her hands. She smiled
and nodded. &ldquo;Speak quietly, boys. We like Lenora
to sleep as late as she can,&rdquo; was her admonition.</p>
<p>The farmer led the way to the barn and there he
again stood grinning his amusement. The boys
laughed good naturedly. &ldquo;Say, them overalls of
your&rsquo;n, Harry, are sort o&rsquo; baggy, &rsquo;pears like to me.
You could get one o&rsquo; Ma&rsquo;s best pillars in front thar
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger lad agreed. &ldquo;Charles has the best
of it. Our gardener is just about his size. Now if
only we had a couple of wide straw hats with torn
brims, we&rsquo;d look the part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Shaking with mirth, the old man led the boys to
a shed adjoining the barn, where on a row of nails
were several hats ragged and tattered enough to
suit the most exacting comedian. &ldquo;Great!&rdquo; the
younger lad donned one and seizing the milk pail
from the farmer&rsquo;s hand, he struck an attitude, exclaiming
dramatically &ldquo;Lead me to the cow.&rdquo; But
he was to find that a college education did not help
one to milk, and after a few futile efforts he rose,
and, with a flourish, offered the bench to Charles,
who, having often milked, had the task done in
short order. Harry watched the process closely,
declaring that in the evening he would show them.</p>
<p>That same morning Mrs. Poindexter-Jones awakened
feeling better than she had in a long time.</p>
<p>While Miss Dane was busying herself about the
room, the older woman lay thoughtfully gazing at
a double frame picture on the wall. It contained
photographs of two children, one about eight and
the other about five. How beautiful Gwynette had
been with her long golden curls and what a manly
little chap Harold. She sighed deeply. The boy
had not changed but the girl&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>Another thought interrupted: &ldquo;Now that you
and Harold both believe that it may be partly your
fault, you may feel differently toward Gwynette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do love her,&rdquo; the woman had to acknowledge.
&ldquo;One cannot bring up anything from babyhood and
not care, but I was not wise. I overindulged the
child because she was so beautiful, and I was proud
to have people think her my own, and, later, when
she was so heartlessly selfish, I was hurt. Poor
Gwynette.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Aloud she said: &ldquo;Miss Dane, please telephone
the seminary and tell my daughter that I am sending
the carriage for her at four this afternoon. I
want her to come home. Then, when my son comes,
tell him I wish to see him. He told me that he would
be here in the early afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will attend to it.&rdquo; The nurse
glided from the room to telephone Gwynette. Half
an hour later she returned. The woman looked up
almost eagerly. Miss Dane merely said, &ldquo;The message
was given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not care to tell that the girl&rsquo;s voice had
been coldly indifferent. Her reply had been, &ldquo;Very
well. One place does as well as another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon, after a morning cultivating in the fields,
the boys were not sorry when the farmer advised
them to take it easy during the afternoon. The day
was very warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will, just at first, while hardening up.&rdquo;
Harold was afraid the farmer would think that he
was not in earnest about wanting to help, but there
was no twinkle evident in the kind blue eyes of Silas
Warner.</p>
<p>The boys, hoes over their shoulders, walked single
file through the field of corn toward the farmhouse.
The girls had not yet seen them and they expected
to be well laughed at. Nor were they mistaken.
They found Jenny and Lenora out in the kitchen
garden. The former maiden had been gathering
luscious, big, red strawberries, while her friend sat
nearby on a rustic bench. Jenny stood upright, her
basket brimming full, and so she first saw the queer
procession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lenora, do look! Is it or is it not your
brother Charles?&rdquo; The grinning boys doffed their
frayed straw hats and made deep bows. Jenny pretended
to be surprised. &ldquo;Why, Harold, is that you?
I thought Grandpa had hired a tramp or two to help
out. My, but you look hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, young ladies, it does not take much perspicacity
to make that discovery.&rdquo; He mopped his
brow with his handkerchief as he spoke.</p>
<p>Charles laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder on Harold than on
me. We do this sort of thing every day up at the
Agricultural School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, to tease, he added: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you invite
the girls to watch you milk this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I may at that,&rdquo; the younger boy said,
nothing daunted by their laughter. &ldquo;But just now
we must hie us to our cabin. I promised to visit
Mother about two.&rdquo; Then to Charles he suggested:
&ldquo;Before we eat the good lunch Sing Long will have
for us, suppose we go swimming, old man, what
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed! It sounds good to me!&rdquo; Turning to
his sister, Charles took her hand lovingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
over to spend the afternoon with you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Harold, glancing almost shyly at the other girl,
wished he could say the same thing to her. Then
it was he recalled something. &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;Mother wanted me to bring you over to the big
house this afternoon. I call it that to designate it
from the cabin. She is eager to meet my new
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I shall be very glad to meet your
mother.&rdquo; Then smiling tenderly at the girl whose
hand he still held, he said: &ldquo;You do feel stronger
today, don&rsquo;t you, sister?&rdquo; She nodded happily, then
away the two boys ran.</p>
<p>An hour later, refreshed and sleek-looking after
their swim, they sat at a small table on the pine-sheltered
side porch and ate the good lunch Sing
Long had prepared for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is great!&rdquo; Charles enthusiastically exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like Lenora to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better still, in a few days, when she is able to
walk this far, we will invite the girls to dine.&rdquo;
Harold hesitated, flushed a little and added as an
after thought: &ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll ask my sister, too.&rdquo;
Again he had completely forgotten Gwynette. His
good resolution was going to be hard to put into
effect, it would seem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to meet your mother and also
your sister,&rdquo; Charles was saying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>An impulse came to Harold to confide in Charles.
Ought he or ought he not? He knew that he could
trust his new friend and his advice might be invaluable.
And so he began hesitatingly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to tell you something, Charles, which I never told
to anyone else. In fact, it&rsquo;s only recently that Mother
realized I knew about it. But now a complication
has risen. We, Mother and I, don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> is
best to do, and what is more, Silas and Susan Warner
have to be considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me unless you are quite sure that you
want to, old man,&rdquo; Charles said in his frank, friendly
way, adding, &ldquo;We make confidences, sometimes,
rather on an impulse, and wish later that we had
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. There are fellows I wouldn&rsquo;t trust
to keep the matter dark, but I know that you will.
We especially do not wish Jenny Warner to know
or Gwynette, my sister, until we have figured out
whether or not it would be best. Of course, my
mother and the Warners thought they were doing
the right thing. Well, I won&rsquo;t keep you wondering
about it any longer. I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole story as
Mother told it to me only two days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles listened seriously. They had finished
their lunch and had sauntered down to the cliff before
the tale was completed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is a problem,&rdquo; was the first comment.
&ldquo;I can easily understand that your mother
wished to keep the matter a secret, but I do feel
sorry for the girls. No one knows the comfort my
sister has been to me. I would have lost a great joy
out of my life if she had been taken from me&mdash;if
we had grown up without knowing each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would, old man,&rdquo; Harold agreed
heartily. &ldquo;But, you see, I early figured out that
Gwynette couldn&rsquo;t be my own sister, and I have
never really cared for her nor has she for me. Well,
she&rsquo;ll be coming home tomorrow and then you can
tell better, perhaps, after having met her, how to
advise me. Mother said she would abide by my
decision. I asked Mums to postpone for two weeks
an ultimatum in the matter.&rdquo; Then, placing a hand
on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder, he added: &ldquo;Now I must go
over and see Mother. If you care to wait in the
cabin, I&rsquo;ll be back in half an hour. I&rsquo;ll find out when
my mother will be able to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll wait. Lenora ought to rest after
lunch, I suppose. I&rsquo;ll be glad to browse among the
interesting books. Don&rsquo;t hurry on my account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Harold was admitted to his
mother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am keeping awake just for this visit,&rdquo; the
smiling woman said when he had kissed her. &ldquo;Is
your friend with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is at the cabin. I thought perhaps at
first you would rather see me alone. I will go back
and get him if you would like to meet him now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Instead of answering him, the woman turned to
the nurse, who was seated at a window sewing:
&ldquo;Miss Dane, if I sleep for two hours, I might meet
Harold&rsquo;s friend about five, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; The
nurse assented.</p>
<p>To her son she then said, &ldquo;I would like you and
your friend to dine here every evening. Please begin
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She purposely did not tell Harold that his sister
would be at home and would need his companionship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="small">A DIFFICULT PROMISE</span></h2>
<p>When the boys reached the farm, they saw
Jenny dressed in her sunny yellow with the buttercup
wreathed leghorn hat shading her face, and, as
she was walking down the lane carrying a basket, it
was quite evident that she was going away. Harold
felt a distinct sense of disappointment. Lenora was
lying in the hammock under two towering eucalyptus
trees. Charles went to her at once and sat on
the bench near, but Harold, excusing himself, ran
toward the barn where he could see that Jenny was
already in the old buggy backing Dobbin out into
the lane.</p>
<p>Hatless, he arrived just as the girl turned toward
the highway. &ldquo;Whither away, fair maid?&rdquo; the boy
sang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see my very nice teacher, Miss Dearborn.
I had a message from her this morning. She wishes
to see me before three. My heart is rebuking me,
for it is over a week since our classes ended and I&rsquo;ve
been so busy I haven&rsquo;t been over to Hillcrest. I&rsquo;m
glad, though, that she has sent for me, and I hope
she will scold me well. I deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>The boy hesitated. &ldquo;Would I be much in the
way if I went with you?&rdquo; Then eagerly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love
to drive old Dobbin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, of course, could not deprive him of that
pleasure, and so, at her smilingly given assent, the
lad went around to the other side, leaped over a
wheel and took the seat and reins abandoned by the
girl.</p>
<p>Dobbin, seeming to sense that all was ready,
started on a trot toward the gate. Harold turned
to wave back to Charles, who returned the salute.
He was glad to be alone for a time with Lenora.
They were planning to write a combination letter to
their far-away and, as they well knew, lonely father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You care a lot for this Miss Dearborn, Jenny,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Harold turned to one side of the highway
to give the automobiles the right of way on
the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do! I love her and I am always fearful
that I may lose her before my education is completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go away to school somewhere?
Most girls do, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I couldn&rsquo;t leave Grandma and Grandpa.
They are old people and need me. At any time
something might happen that either or both of them
would be unable to work as they do now. I want to
be right here, always, to be their staff when they
need one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>The boy, glancing at the girl, could readily tell
that what she had said had come from her heart. It
had been neither for effect nor from a sense of duty.</p>
<p>The boy changed the subject. &ldquo;You will miss
Lenora when she is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an almost tragic expression in the
liquid brown eyes that were turned toward him.
&ldquo;No one can know <i>how</i> I shall miss her. It has
been wonderful to have someone near one&rsquo;s own age
to confide in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I do when Lenora is gone?&rdquo; Harold
ventured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not such a lot older than you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; Jenny smilingly retorted. &ldquo;Girl
confidences would seem foolish to you.&rdquo; Then, as
they drove between the pepper-tree posts, she exclaimed,
&ldquo;I surely deserve a scolding for having so
long neglected my beloved teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dearborn did not scold Jenny. There was
in her face an expression which at once assured
the girl that something of an unusual nature had
occurred. Harold had remained in the wagon and
the two, who cared so much for each other, were
alone in the charming library and living-room of
Hill-Crest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dearborn. Oh, what has happened? I
know something has.&rdquo; Then seeing a suitcase
standing near, locked and strapped, the girl became
more than ever fearful. &ldquo;You are going away.
Oh, Miss Dearborn, are you?&rdquo; Tears sprang to the
eagerly questioning brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear girl, I am going to Carmel. I had
told you that Eric Austin and his family are living
there. Last night a telegram came, sent by that
dear sister-friend herself. She is ill and wants me
to come at once. Of course I am going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone called Miss Dearborn to another
room. When she returned she said, &ldquo;A taxicab will
be here shortly.&rdquo; As she donned her hat, she continued
talking. &ldquo;No one knows how sincerely I hope
my schoolmate will recover. She is so happily married,
she dearly loves her husband and her children.
Oh, Jeanette, it is so sad when a mother is taken
away. There is no one, <i>just no one</i> who can take
her place to the little ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl asked, &ldquo;How many children are there,
Miss Dearborn? I remember you said one girl had
been named after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, then there is a boy, a year or two older, and
this baby, the one that has just come!&rdquo; She took
up the suitcase, but Jenny held out her hand. &ldquo;Please
let me carry it.&rdquo; The teacher did so, as she had to
close and lock the front door. Harold sprang from
the wagon. &ldquo;Miss Dearborn,&rdquo; the girl said, &ldquo;you
have heard me speak of our neighbors, the Poindexter-Jones.
This is my friend Harold.&rdquo; The lad,
cap under his arm, took the outstretched hand,
acknowledging the introduction, then reached for
the suitcase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Sounds of an automobile laboring up the rough
hill-road assured them, before they saw the small
closed car, that the taxi was arriving.</p>
<p>Jenny held her teacher&rsquo;s hand in a close clasp and
her eyes were again brimmed with tears. This time
for the mother of the little new baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, dear girl.&rdquo; The woman turned to the
boy and said, &ldquo;Take good care of my Jeanette.
Even she does not know what a comfort she is
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had replied something, he hardly knew
what. Of course he would take care of Jenny.
With his life, if need be. When the taxi was gone
he took the girl&rsquo;s arm and led her back to the wagon.
He saw that she was almost crying and he knew
that her dear friend must be starting on some sad
mission, but Jenny merely said, when they were
driving down the canyon road, &ldquo;Miss Dearborn has
a college friend living in Carmel and she is very ill
and has sent for her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>After a time he spoke aloud his own thoughts.
&ldquo;Jeanette, that is what your teacher called you. It
reminds me of my sister&rsquo;s name somewhat.&rdquo; He
hesitated. He was on dangerous ground. He must
be very careful of what he said. The girl turned
toward him glowingly. &ldquo;How lucky you are, Harold,
to have a real sister. She must be a good pal
for you. Is she to be at home soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tomorrow.&rdquo; The boy hesitated, then he
said slowly, thinking ahead: &ldquo;Jenny, Mother and
I feel that we haven&rsquo;t brought Gwyn up just right.
We have helped her to be proud and selfish. I&rsquo;m
going to ask you a favor. Will you try to win her
friendship and be patient and not hurt if she seems
to snub you just at first? Will you, Jenny?&rdquo; The
boy was very much in earnest, and so the girl replied,
&ldquo;Why, Harold, I will try, if you wish, but I
know that your sister does not want my friendship,
so why should she be forced to have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wish it,&rdquo; was all the lad would reply.
Jenny knew better than the boy did how difficult it
would be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE HAUGHTY GWYNETTE</span></h2>
<p>True to his promise, Harold took Charles to the
&ldquo;big house&rdquo; just before five, the hour of his mother&rsquo;s
appointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a beautiful home,&rdquo; the visiting lad
remarked as he was led along box-edged paths and
paused to gaze into the mirror-clear, sun-sparkled
water in the pond lily garden. Lotus flowers were
lying on the still blue surface, waxen lovely and
sweetly fragrant.</p>
<p>They went up the marble steps, crossed the portico
and entered a long wide hall which led directly
to the front door through the windows of which the
late afternoon sun was streaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The library is my favorite room,&rdquo; Harold said.
&ldquo;I will leave you there while I go up and see if
mother is ready to meet my new friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were nearing a wide door where rich, crimson
velvet portiers hung, when Harold heard his
name spoken back of him. Turning, he saw Miss
Dane beckoning to him. After speaking with her
he said: &ldquo;Charles, wait in the library for me. I
won&rsquo;t be gone long. Mother wishes to speak to me
alone for just a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Charles stopped to look at a very beautiful painting
before he stepped between the velvet portiers.
At once he saw that the room was occupied. &ldquo;Pardon
me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. A girl had risen and was
staring at him with amazement, but her momentary
indignation was changed to interest when she saw
how good-looking and well-dressed he was. With
a graciousness she could always assume when she
wished, Gwynette assured him: &ldquo;Indeed you are
not intruding. I heard my brother tell you to wait
here until he came. Won&rsquo;t you be seated? I am
Gwynette, Harold&rsquo;s sister. He may have told you
about me?&rdquo; The lad was amazed. Even while he
was assuring the girl that he had indeed heard of
her his thought was inquiring, &ldquo;How could Harold
find it hard to care for such a graceful, beautiful
sister, even though she was adopted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette had resumed the seat she had occupied
formerly, a deep softly upholstered leather chair
drawn close to the wide hearth on which a drift log
was burning with flames of many colors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; the lad sat in the chair on the opposite
side of the hearth to which she motioned him, &ldquo;since
Harold is not here to introduce me, will tell you
who I am and how I happen to be here.&rdquo; Then he
hesitated, gazing inquiringly at the girl whose every
pose was one of grace. &ldquo;You probably know my
sister, Lenora Gale, since she was at the Granger
Place Seminary for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there was a stiffening on the part of the girl,
it was not perceptible. If her thought was rather
disdainfully &ldquo;another farmer&rdquo;, she did not lessen
her apparent interest. Her reply, though not enthusiastic,
was in the affirmative, modified with, &ldquo;I
really cannot say that I knew your sister well, however.
She was not in my classes and our rooms
were far apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with just the right amount of seeming
solicitude, &ldquo;She is quite well now, I hope. I understand
that she went to stay at my mother&rsquo;s farm
with our overseer&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles glanced up at her quickly. Gwyn could
not long play a part without revealing her true self.
&ldquo;Very wonderful people, the Warners,&rdquo; was what
the young man said. &ldquo;It has been a privilege to
meet them. Lenora, I am glad to say, is daily becoming
stronger and within a fortnight we will be
able to travel to our far-away home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and the girl said, now with less interest,
&ldquo;A ranch, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a ranch.&rdquo; Silence fell between them.
Gwynette gazed into the fire, torn between her scorn
for her companion&rsquo;s station in life and her admiration
of his magnetic personality. Suddenly she
smiled at him and Charles felt that he had never
seen any girl more beautiful. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she
said with apparent naivete, &ldquo;it is hard for me to
believe that you are a farmer; you impress me as
being a gentleman to the manner born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad, who was her senior by several years,
smiled. &ldquo;Miss Gwynette,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;I am far
more proud of being a rancher than I would be of
inheriting a title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold returned just then to say that his mother
was ready to receive their guest. The younger lad
was amazed at the graciousness with which his
usually fretful sister assured Charles Gale that she
was indeed glad he was to be with them for dinner.</p>
<p>When the two boys were quite out of hearing,
Harold gave a low whistle. Clapping his friend on
the shoulder, he said softly: &ldquo;Charles, you&rsquo;re a
miracle worker. I haven&rsquo;t seen such a radiant smile
from Gwyn in more days than I can remember.&rdquo;
The other lad replied in a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you
took me into your confidence. I may be able to help
you solve your problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold asked with sincere eagerness, &ldquo;You think
that perhaps Gwyn can be changed without taking
the extreme measure of telling her that she is Jenny
Warner&rsquo;s own sister?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Charles nodded. &ldquo;The ideal thing would be to
so change Gwynette that she would be glad to learn
that she had a sister all her very own.&rdquo; Harold
shook his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done, old man, unless
that sister proved to be an heiress or an earl&rsquo;s
daughter.&rdquo; The boy laughed at a sudden recollection.
&ldquo;Poor Gwyn had a most unfortunate experience
and sort of made herself the laughing stock of
her crowd over at the seminary,&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;She
heard that there was a girl in the school whose
father was a younger son of English nobility who
might some day be Lady Something-or-other.
Gwyn decided that <i>that</i> girl should be cultivated,
but, unfortunately, the young lady had requested
that her identity be kept a secret. No one but Miss
Granger knew it. The principal had been proud,
evidently, of the fact that a member of a noble
English family attended her school, and had let that
much be known.&rdquo; Charles smiled. &ldquo;I thought
America was democratic and cared nothing for
class,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They had stopped on the circling, softly-carpeted
stairway while they talked. Being far from the
library, they had no fear of being overheard by
Gwyn. Harold replied: &ldquo;Well, there are some of
us who care nothing at all for class, but every country
has its snobs and Gwyn is one, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles appeared interested. &ldquo;Did she manage
to identify the girl who might some day have a
title?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Again Harold laughed. &ldquo;Poor Gwyn, it really
was very funny. She selected a big, handsome
blonde who ordered the maids about in an imperious
manner and, more than that, she gave a dance at
The Palms, inviting her to be the guest of honor.
I brought down a bunch of cadets from the big town
and it happened one of them hailed from Chicago,
and so did the handsome blonde. He told us that
she was a Swede and that her father had made a
fortune raising pigs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles could not refrain from smiling. &ldquo;That
was hard on your sister, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The other lad nodded. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare refer to
it in Gwyn&rsquo;s hearing, but come on! Mother will
wonder where we are all this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poindexter-Jones was as much pleased with
Harold&rsquo;s new friend as Gwynette had been, and, in
the brief ten moments that the boys stayed with the
invalid, she became convinced that he was just the
lad she would like to have in the cliff cabin with
her son. When the nurse appeared with a warning
nod at Harold, the boys at once arose, and the
woman, reclining among her pillows, smiled as she
held out a frail hand. &ldquo;Charles Gale,&rdquo; she said
kindly, &ldquo;we are glad indeed to have you with us.
Remain as long as you can, and, when your sister
is stronger, I would like to have that dear little
Warner girl bring her to call upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>On the way down the wide circling flight of stairs
Charles said softly, &ldquo;Your mother seems to like
Jenny Warner.&rdquo; The other nodded. &ldquo;Yes, she
does. She wonders if, had she chosen Jeanette, as
she calls her, and the Warners had taken Gwynette,
the girls would have been different. Susan Warner
declares that if her Jenny had been brought up as
a princess she would still have been simple and loving,
going about doing good as she does now. She
is the bright angel to a family of Italians living in
Sycamore Canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soft chimes from the dining-room told them that
the dinner hour had arrived, and so Harold went
to the library to escort his sister, Charles following.
Again the bright smile greeted them. Rising, the
girl said, &ldquo;Brother, Ma Mere told me, when I
arrived from the seminary this afternoon, that
I need not remain here this summer unless I so
desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Charles she explained, &ldquo;I did feel so neglected
when Mother sent me to this out-of-the-way country
school. I wanted to be with her in France. The
resort where she was staying is simply charming,
and one meets people there from the very best English
families. For some reason, however, I had to
be buried out here.&rdquo; Then, after an expressive
shrug, she added with renewed interest: &ldquo;Ma Mere
has heard of a select party sailing from San Francisco
next week, and if I wish, I may join it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>While Gwyn had been talking, they had sauntered
to the dining-room and were seated in a group at
one end of the long, highly-polished table. Charles,
listening attentively, now realized how truly selfish
the girl was. He was recalling another girl in a
far-distant scene. When their mother had been ill,
Lenora could hardly be persuaded to leave her bedside
long enough to obtain the rest she needed, and
that illness had lasted many months. Indeed, it was
not until after the mother had died that the girl
could be persuaded to think of herself, and then it
was found, as Charles and his father had feared,
that she had used up far more vitality than she could
spare and she had not been strong since. He tried
not to feel critically toward the beautiful girl at his
side. Purposely he did not glance at Harold. That
boy had flushed uncomfortably, and, at, last, he
spoke his thoughts, which he evidently had tried to
refrain from doing. &ldquo;Gwyn, don&rsquo;t you suppose, if
you stayed at home, you might make our mother&rsquo;s
long hours in bed pleasanter for her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s tone was just tinged with irritation.
&ldquo;No, Harold, I do not. Mother does not find my
companionship restful and Miss Dane surely does
for her all that is humanly possible.&rdquo; Gwyn was
distinctly uncomfortable. She felt that the conversation
was not putting her in an enviable light and
she had truly wished to impress Charles Gale, for
the time being, at least. She had no desire to have
the admiration a lasting one, since he was merely a
rancher&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Gwynette had one ambition and that was to make
a most desirable marriage soon after her eighteenth
birthday, which was not many months away. She
was convinced that, after her debut into San Francisco&rsquo;s
most select &ldquo;Younger Set&rdquo;, she would soon
meet the man of her dreams. She never doubted
but that <i>he</i> at once would love her and desire to
make her his wife. But just now it would be gratifying
to her vanity to have so handsome a young
giant as Charles Gale admire her. Poor Gwyn at
that moment was far from having accomplished this.
Charles <i>did</i> admire beauty, and thought how charming
she would be, were she not so superlatively
selfish.</p>
<p>Harold changed the subject. &ldquo;Gwyn, we boys
are going to the farm after dinner. Will you go
with us? Charles naturally wishes to spend the
evenings with his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Both boys waited, though not appearing to do so,
for the girl&rsquo;s reply. Her brother well knew that she
would not want to go to the farm and associate with
her mother&rsquo;s servants, as she called Susan and Silas
Warner and their granddaughter, but, on the other
hand, Harold could easily see that his sister was
much impressed with Charles Gale and might wish
to accompany them for the sake of his companionship
if for no other reason.</p>
<p>Gwyn <i>did</i> accept, after a moment&rsquo;s thought. She
knew that, all alone in the big house, she would be
frightfully bored. And so, half an hour later, the
three started out across the gardens, under the pines
and along the cliff, where in the early twilight a full
moon, rising from the sea, was sending toward them
a path of silver. Gwynette paused and looked out
across the water for a long silent moment. When
she spoke, it was to her brother. &ldquo;Harold, I&rsquo;ve
never before been along this cliff. In fact,&rdquo; this to
Charles, &ldquo;all of my life has been spent either in San
Francisco or abroad. This is the first year that
Mother has seemed to want to come to Santa Barbara.
I always supposed it was because it reminded
her of our father, who died here so long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do not know the beautiful spots that
are everywhere around your own home,&rdquo; Charles
said, and his voice was more kindly than it had
been. He was sorry for the girl who had been
brought up among people who thought that ascending
the social ladder was the one thing to be desired.
He knew, for Harold had told him, how sincerely
the mother regretted all this, but now that the girl&rsquo;s
character was formed, they feared that only some
extreme measure, such as revealing to her who she
really was, could change her. Charles, who was a
deep student of human nature, felt that the girl&rsquo;s
sincere joy in the loveliness of the path of silver
light on the sea was a hopeful sign. Harold was
thinking, &ldquo;That is the first resemblance to Jenny
Warner that I have noticed. <i>She</i> loves nature in
all its moods.&rdquo; At their first tap on the front door,
it was flung open and Jenny, in her yellow dress,
greeted them joyfully, pausing, however, and hesitating
when she saw by whom the boys were accompanied.
One glimpse into the old-fashioned farm
&ldquo;parlor&rdquo;, with its haircloth-covered furniture, its
wax wreath under a glass, its tidies on the chairs,
its framed mottoes on the walls, beside chromo pictures
of Susan and Si Warner made when they
were married, filled Gwynette with shuddering
dread. She couldn&rsquo;t, she wouldn&rsquo;t associate with
these people as equals. Had she not been an honored
guest in the homes of millionaires in San Francisco
and abroad? But, distasteful as it all was to her,
she found herself advancing over the threshold
when Charles stepped aside to permit her to enter
ahead of him. Jenny, remembering her promise to
Harold, held out her hand, rather diffidently, but
Gwynette was apparently looking in another direction,
and so it was Harold who took it, and,
although his greeting was the customary one, his
eyes expressed the gratitude that he felt because
Jenny had <i>tried</i> to fulfill her promise to him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
bother about it any more,&rdquo; he said in a low voice
aside, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo; Of course the girl did
not know just what he meant, but she resolved not
to be discouraged by one failure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><span class="small">GWYN&rsquo;S AWAKENING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, wall,&rdquo; it was Silas Warner who entered
the parlor five moments later, rubbing his hands
and smiling his widest, &ldquo;this here looks like a celebration
or some sech. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s birthday,
is it, Jenny-gal, that yer givin&rsquo; a party for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I wish it were, though,&rdquo; Harold exclaimed,
&ldquo;then Grandma Sue would make one of
her famous mountain chocolate cakes.&rdquo; He looked
around the group beseechingly. &ldquo;Say, can&rsquo;t one of
you raise a birthday within the next fortnight. It
will be worth the effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora flashed a smile across the room at her
brother. &ldquo;Charles can,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;He will
be twenty-one on the twenty-fifth of June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Then turning to the smiling old woman
who sat near Jenny in the most comfortable rocker
the room afforded, &ldquo;Grandma Sue, I implore that
your heart be touched! Will you make us a cake
twenty-one layers high, with chocolate in between
an inch thick? I&rsquo;ll bring the candles and the ice
cream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Jenny, who for the first time was surrounded by
young people, caught Harold&rsquo;s holiday spirit and
clapping her hands impulsively, she cried, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
that be fun! Grandma Sue, you&rsquo;ll let us have a real
party for Charles&rsquo; birthday, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the old woman was only too happy to
agree to their plans. While she and Jenny were
talking, Harold sat back and looked at the two girls,
the &ldquo;unlike sisters&rdquo; as he found himself calling
them. Gwynette sat on the edge of a slipper haircloth
chair, the stiffest in the room. There was an
unmistakable sneer in the curve of her mouth, which
was quite as sensitive as Jenny&rsquo;s but lacking the
sweet cheerful upturn at the corners. Nor was
Harold the only one who was thinking about this
very evident likeness, or unlikeness.</p>
<p>Farmer Si, chewing a toothpick (of all plebeian
things!), stood warming his back at the nickel-plated
parlor stove, hands back of him, teetering now and
then from heel to toe and ruminating. &ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; was
his self-satisfied conclusion, &ldquo;who wants her can
have &rsquo;tother one. Ma and me got the best of that
little drawin&rsquo; deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that birthday is a whole week away,&rdquo; Harold
was saying, &ldquo;and here is a perfectly good evening
to spend. The question before the house is,
how shall we spend it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O, I know,&rdquo; Lenora leaned forward eagerly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make popcorn balls. Brother and I used to
call that the greatest kind of treat when we were
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette&rsquo;s cold voice cut in with: &ldquo;But <i>we</i> are
<i>not</i> children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold leaped up exclaiming, &ldquo;Maybe you are
not, Gwyn, but the rest of us are. Grandma Sue,
may we borrow your kitchen if we leave it as spotless
as we find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette rose, saying coldly, &ldquo;I am very tired.
I think I will go home now.&rdquo; Harold was filled
with consternation. He, of course, would have to
accompany his sister, but, before he could speak,
Charles was saying: &ldquo;I will walk over with you,
Miss Gwynette, if you will permit me to do so. I
haven&rsquo;t had nearly my usual amount of outdoor
exercise today, and I&rsquo;d be glad to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette flashed a grateful glance at him, and,
wishing to appear well in his eyes, she actually
crossed the room and held out her hand to the old
woman, who, with the others, had risen. &ldquo;Goodnight,
Mrs. Warner,&rdquo; she began, then surprised
herself by ending with&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you will invite me
to the birthday party.&rdquo; She bit her lip with vexation
as soon as she was outdoors. She had not
meant to say it. Why had she? It was the same
as acknowledging that she considered herself an
equal socially with the Warners and the Gales, who
also were farmers. She knew the answer, even
though she would not admit it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a warm, pleasant evening it is,&rdquo; Charles
said when the door of the farmhouse had closed
behind them. &ldquo;Would it bore you terribly, Miss
Gwynette, to go out on the point of rocks with me
for a moment? I&rsquo;d like to see the surf closer in the
moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo; Gwynette was honest, at least,
when she made this reply. She liked to be with this
good-looking young giant who carried himself as a
Grecian god might have done.</p>
<p>Taking her arm, the young man assisted the slender,
graceful girl from rock to rock until they had
reached the highest point. There Charles noted the
canopied rock where Lenora and Jenny sat on the
first day of their visit to the point together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it too cool, do you think, to sit here a moment?&rdquo;
Gwynette asked somewhat shyly. For answer,
the lad drew off his outer coat, folded it and
placed it on the stone. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; he
said, when she protested. &ldquo;This slipover sweater
of mine is all that I usually wear, but I put on the
coat tonight in honor of the ladies.&rdquo; Then, folding
his arms, he stood silently near, watching the truly
inspiring scene. One great breaker after another
rolled quietly in, lifting a foaming crest as it neared
the shore, glistening like fairy snow in the silver
of the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The surf doesn&rsquo;t roar tonight, the way it does
sometimes,&rdquo; the lad said, dropping at last to the
rock at the girl&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Watch now when the next
wave breaks, how all of the spray glistens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments neither spoke and, in Gwynette&rsquo;s
starved soul something stirred again, this time
more distinctly. It was an intense love of nature
that she had inherited, with Jenny, from a wandering
poet-missionary father. She caught her breath
when spray and mist dashed almost up to them.
&ldquo;O, it is lovely, lovely!&rdquo; she said, for once being
perfectly sincere and forgetting herself. &ldquo;I never
saw anything so exquisite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles was more than pleased. Perhaps he was
to find the soul of the girl at his side. Harold did
not believe that she had one. As he glanced down
at her now and then her real joy in the beauty of
the scene before them, he concluded that she was
fully as beautiful as her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where the silver path leads,&rdquo; she said
whimsically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a sailboat here,&rdquo; the lad exclaimed,
&ldquo;and if you would be my passenger, we&rsquo;d sail over
that silver stream and find where it leads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>The girl looked up at him. Her new emotion had
changed the expression of her face. It was no
longer cynical and cold. &ldquo;Our father had a sailboat,
but for years it has been hanging to the rafters
of the boathouse. Perhaps Harold would like to
take it down, now that he is to be here all summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I&rsquo;ll ask him!&rdquo; the lad was enthusiastic.
&ldquo;I suppose you wonder how I, a farmer from the
inland, learned to sail. It was the year before
mother died that we all went to Lake Tahoe, hoping
that the change of air would benefit her. A splendid
sailboat was one of the accessories of the cabin we
rented, and how I reveled in it. I do hope Harold
will loan me his boat. It seems calm enough beyond
the surf. In fact I saw several boats today evidently
racing around a buoy over toward the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a yacht club at Santa Barbara and
they have a wonderful harbor. Harold has been
invited to join the club. I would like to attend one
of their dances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl hesitated to ask her companion if he
could dance. Probably not, having been brought up
on an isolated ranch. To her relief the question
was answered without having been asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I like skating better than dancing, but,
when the music pleases me and my partner, I do
enjoy dancing.&rdquo; Gwyn found that she must
reconstruct her preconvinced ideas about Dakota
farmers. Then, after silently watching the waves
for a thoughtful moment, he turned toward her as
he smilingly said: &ldquo;Miss Gwynette, do you suppose
that you and I could go to the next Yacht Club
dance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes were glowing.
Now indeed the resemblance to Jenny was
marked. &ldquo;We have the entree everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked side by side toward the big house.
Gwyn was conscious of being happier than she had
ever been in all her seventeen years. Then she realized,
with a pang of regret, that in two weeks this
companion who seemed to understand her better
than did anyone else, would be gone.</p>
<p>At the foot of the steps she turned and held out
her hand. &ldquo;Goodnight, Mr. Gale,&rdquo; she said simply.
&ldquo;Thank you for escorting me home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><span class="small">CONFLICTING EMOTIONS</span></h2>
<p>Harold was more than glad to grant his sister&rsquo;s
request that the sailboat, which for years had been
suspended in the boathouse, should be lowered and
launched. Naturally, after having dried for so long
leaks appeared as soon as it was afloat in the quiet
cove sheltered by the little peninsula, Rocky Point.
Again it was drawn up and a merry morning the
two boys spent with the help of an old man about
the place who at one time had sailed the seas. The
cracks were caulked and again the pretty craft
floated, seeming to dance for joy, over the smoothly
rolling waves, when it was tied to the buoy a short
distance from shore. The rowboat had been used
by the gardener for fishing excursions, and so that
was in readiness. The boys had been glad to find
that, though the sails were somewhat yellowed, they
had been so carefully rolled away and covered that
no repairs were necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better make a trial trip in the craft before
we take the ladies,&rdquo; Charles suggested when, dressed
in their overalls, they paused on their way to the
farm the next morning to look out at the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>It was that very day that Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
again decided that she would like to be taken to the
pond-lily garden and have Jenny Warner read to
her. When, leaning on Miss Dane&rsquo;s arm, she arrived
in the charming shrub-sheltered nook, she saw
Gwynette lying in a hammock which was stretched
between two sycamore trees near. The girl at once
arose and went forward to greet her mother with an
expression of real solicitude which the woman had
never before seen in her daughter&rsquo;s face. She even
glanced again to be sure that she had not been mistaken.
Brightly the girl said, &ldquo;Good morning, Ma
Mere. I&rsquo;m glad you are able to be out this lovely
day. I was just coming to your room to ask if
you&rsquo;d like me to read aloud to you. I found such a
good story in the library, a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pleased woman glanced at the book the girl
held. It was the one in which Jenny Warner had
read a few chapters.</p>
<p>There was a glad light in the eyes of the girl&rsquo;s
foster-mother.</p>
<p>Gwyn saw it, and for the first time in her life
her conscience stirred, rebuking her for having
never before thought of doing anything to add to
her mother&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>What the older woman said was: &ldquo;I shall be
more than glad to have my daughter read to me.
I was just about to send for Jenny Warner. Before
you came home she started to read that very book
to me, but we were only at the beginning.&rdquo; Gwynette
flushed. &ldquo;Oh, if you would rather have&mdash;&rdquo; she
began. But her mother, hearing the hurt tone and
wishing to follow up any advantage the moment
might be offering, hurriedly said: &ldquo;Indeed I would
far rather have you read to me than anyone else,
dear Gwynette. I had not asked you because I did
not know that you would care to.&rdquo; There was an
almost pathetic note in the voice which again carried
a rebuke to the heart of the girl.</p>
<p>Miss Dane left them, after having arranged her
patient in the comfortable reclining chair.</p>
<p>Gwynette, having read by herself to the chapter
where Jenny had stopped, began to read aloud and
the woman, leaning back luxuriously at ease, listened
with a growing tenderness in her eyes. How beautiful
Gwynette was, and surely there was a changed
expression which had come within the last few days.
<i>What</i> could have caused it? Why did she seem
more content to remain in the country? The girl
had not again mentioned the party for European
travel which she had seemed so eager to join when
her mother had proposed it. Half an hour later she
suggested that they stop reading and visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said, and Gwynette actually thrilled
at the new tenderness in her mother&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
going to bore you as much as you thought to remain
here with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose and sat on a stool near the reclining
chair. &ldquo;Ma Mere,&rdquo; she said, and there were actually
tears in her eyes, &ldquo;I have been very unhappy, miserably
dissatisfied, and I sometimes think that what I
am yearning for is love. I have had adulation,&rdquo;
she spoke somewhat bitterly. &ldquo;I have demanded a
sort of homage from the girls in my set wherever
I was. I think often they grudgingly gave it. I&rsquo;ve
had lots of time to think about all these things during
the last two weeks when Beulah and Patricia,
who had been my best friends in San Francisco,
were busy with final tests. I knew, when I faced
the thing squarely, out there in the summer-house
where I spent so many hours alone. I knew that
neither of those girls really cared for me&mdash;I mean
with their hearts&mdash;the way they did for each other,
and it made me feel lonely&mdash;left out. I don&rsquo;t know
as I had ever felt that way before, and then, when
I came over here, that first day after you came home,
you talked about Harold with such loving tenderness,
and again I felt so neglected.&rdquo; She looked up,
for the woman had been about to speak. &ldquo;Let me
finish, Ma Mere, please, for I may never again feel
that I <i>want</i> to tell what I think. I have been locked
up so long. I&rsquo;ve been too proud to tell anyone that
I <i>knew</i> Harold did not really care for me, that every
little thing he did for me was because he considered
it a duty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>His mother knew this to be true, for her son had
made the same confidence the day he had arrived
from school. Her only comment was to lay her
hand lovingly on the brown head. A caress had not
occurred between these two, not since Gwynette had
been a little girl.</p>
<p>There were unshed tears in the woman&rsquo;s eyes.
How blind she had been. After all, Gwynette was
not entirely to blame. Well the foster-mother knew
that she had encouraged the high-spirited girl to be
proud and haughty. For many years Mrs. Poindexter-Jones
had considered social standing of more
importance than all else, but, during the long months
that she had been ill, an idle watcher of the throngs
who visited the famous health resort in France,
something of the foolishness of it all had come to
her and she had readjusted her sense of real values,
scarcely knowing when it had happened. She had
much to regret, much to try to undo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear girl,&rdquo; she said, and there was in her voice
a waver as though it were hard for her to speak, and
yet she was determined to do so, &ldquo;I fear I have done
you a great wrong. I have taught you to be proud,
to scorn worthiness in your fellow-men, or, if not
exactly that, to place class distinction above it.
Now I know that character is the true test of what
a man is, not how much money he has or what his
place in society. Of course, it is but right that we
should choose our friends from among those people
who interest us, but not from among those who can
benefit us in a worldly way. Gwynette, daughter, is
it too late for me to undo the wrong that I have
done in giving you these false standards and ideals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there were indeed tears quivering on the
lashes of the older woman. The girl was touched,
as she never before had been. &ldquo;Oh, Mother!&rdquo; It
was really a yearning cry. &ldquo;Then you <i>do</i> love me.
You do care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dane appeared at the moment and the older
woman merely smiled at the girl, but with such an
expression of infinite tenderness that, when the invalid
had been led away, there was a most unusual
warmth in Gwynette&rsquo;s heart. She rose and walked
down to the cliff. She wanted, oh, her mother could
not know how very much she wanted to free herself
from the old standards, because she admired, more
than she had ever before admired anyone, the son
of a mere rancher. She stood gazing at the boat
and thinking so intently of these things that she did
not hear footsteps near, but how her heart rejoiced
when she heard a voice asking, &ldquo;Will you go to the
Yacht Club dance with me this evening, Miss Gwynette?
Harold has procured the necessary tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>Would she go? Gwynette turned such a glowingly
radiant face toward the questioner that he
marveled at her beauty. How could he know that it
was the magic of his friendship which had wrought
this almost unbelievable transformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how splendid! The Yacht Club is a beautiful
place and the music they have is simply divine.&rdquo;
Then she hesitated and looked doubtful, &ldquo;but I
haven&rsquo;t a new party gown and I wore my old one
there last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How trivial and unimportant the young man&rsquo;s
hearty laugh made her remark seem, and what he
said might have been called brutally frank: &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t suppose that anyone will recall what Miss
Gwynette Poindexter-Jones wore on that particular
occasion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl flushed, although she knew the rebuke
contained in the remark had not been intentionally
unkind. Yet she could not resist saying, with a
touch of her old hauteur, &ldquo;You mean that no one
will remember me.&rdquo; Then the native common sense
which had seldom been given an opportunity to express
itself came to save her from petty displeasure.
&ldquo;You are right, Sir Charles,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;of
course no one there tonight will recall the gown I
wore; in fact they won&rsquo;t remember <i>me</i> at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad had glanced quickly at the girl when she
had called him &ldquo;Sir Charles,&rdquo; but, noting that it had
been but a teasing preface to her remark, he stood by
her side for a silent moment gazing out at the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Harold and I are going for a sail this afternoon,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;if the craft doesn&rsquo;t leak. We want to try
it out before we take the young ladies for a sail. My
sister Lenora used to love to be my passenger when
we were up at Lake Tahoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn did not know why she asked, just a bit
coyly, &ldquo;Was your sister your <i>only</i> passenger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply was frankly given: &ldquo;No indeed! There
were several young ladies at a nearby inn who
accompanied us at different times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold came up just then and said: &ldquo;Well, Gwyn,
are you going to watch the famous sailors perform
this afternoon? Jenny and Lenora have promised
to be out on Rocky Point to encourage us with their
presence, so to speak.&rdquo; Charles looked keenly at the
girl as he said: &ldquo;I would be pleased if you would
join them, Miss Gwyn. I would like you to know
my sister better. You will love her when you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had turned and were walking toward the
house. Gwynette did not in the least want to go.
After hesitating, she replied: &ldquo;I planned looking
over my gown. It may need some alterations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>Even as she spoke, she knew that her words did
not ring true. She sensed, more than saw, that
Charles was disappointed in her. He began at once
to talk about sailing to Harold, and, for the rest of
the walk she might have been quite alone. Her
brother realized that Gwyn had not been courteous.
She should, at least, have replied that she was <i>sure</i>
she would like the sister of Charles. He, Harold,
had said nothing of Jenny. He was not going to
have his friend again humiliated by Gwyn&rsquo;s haughty
disdain. He was almost glad that she had invented
an excuse for remaining away.</p>
<p>Gwyn lunched alone in the big formal dining-room.
The boys had departed for their cabin, where
Sing Long had prepared their midday meal as usual.
The girl had hoped they would invite her to accompany
them, but they had not done so.</p>
<p>After lunch she went to her room and took out
the gown. She well knew that it was in perfect
repair, for had she not worn it to the party she had
given at The Palms in honor of the girl she had
<i>supposed</i> was related to nobility? How foolish she
had been! She did not much blame Patricia and
Beulah for laughing at her. In all probability there
had been no such girl in the seminary, and if there
had been, what possible difference could it make to
her? Then she recalled what her mother had said:
&ldquo;It is <i>character</i> that counts, not class distinction.&rdquo;
Gwyn was decidedly unhappy. She laid the filmy,
truly exquisite gown on her bed and stood gazing
out of her window. She saw the sailboat gliding
past. She decided that at least she would go out on
the cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><span class="small">THREE GIRLS</span></h2>
<p>Gwynette, dressed in a corn-yellow linen with
tailored lines and wearing a very becoming sport
hat of the same material and color, trimmed with
old blue and orange, sauntered out to the cliff. She
had intended to remain there on a rustic bench to
watch the boys sail to and fro, hoping, though
scarcely believing, that they would eventually land
at the small pier at their boathouse. Another
thought prompted: &ldquo;They are far more apt to land
nearer the Point of Rocks. Charles will want to be
with his sister, and Harold cares much more for
that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated, for even in her
thought she did not like to connect her brother&rsquo;s
name with the granddaughter of her mother&rsquo;s
servants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>Rising, and without definite decision to do so,
she sauntered along the cliff in the direction of the
rocky point. She saw the two girls seated on the
highest rock, and just at that moment they were
waving seaward, and so Gwyn decided that the sailboat
must be nearing the shore. A low-growing
old pine hid the water from her view. When she
had passed it, she glanced quickly out at the gleaming,
dancing waves, and there, turning for a tack,
was the boat she sought. Charles, at the rudder,
saw her at once and waved his hat. She flushed.
He would know that she was going over to the point
to be with the other girls. Half angry with herself,
when she realized that she was doing it merely to
please him, and not in the least because it was her
own desire, she actually paused, determining to turn
back, but before she had done so, Jenny, having
glanced around, saw her, and so it was too late to
retreat even if she had really wished to do so. Remembering
her promise to Harold, Jenny called in
her most friendly manner, &ldquo;Oh, Miss Poindexter-Jones,
won&rsquo;t you come over on the Reviewing Rocks,
as Harold calls them? We have a wonderful view
of the boat from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette went, and if her smile was faint, it was
at least a smile, and Jenny felt encouraged. She
gave up her own position. &ldquo;Do sit here,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;this seat is really as comfortable as a rock can be.
I would offer to go to the house for a cushion, but
Lenora has the only two that we own and she needs
them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do not.&rdquo; The seated girl protested,
and she was about to draw out the one against which
she was leaning, but Gwyn had the good grace to
at once declare that her gown washed nicely and
she did not in the least mind sitting on the rocks.
Then they turned to watch the antics of the sailboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Charles is in his element now.&rdquo; It was evident
from her tone that Lenora was very proud of her
brother. &ldquo;When we were at Tahoe the daughters
of the wealthy cottagers and guests at Tahoe Inn
were always eager to have him accompany them,
not only sailing but everywhere.&rdquo; With a little
laugh she concluded, &ldquo;As you may guess, I have a
very popular brother.&rdquo; Then, more seriously, as she
recalled why they had been at the lake, far-famed
for its beauty:	&ldquo;But Charles refused nearly all
invitations that he might remain with our dear
mother, who was frail. In fact, the only ones he
accepted were those that Mother and I insisted that
he should not refuse. But, oftenest of all, Charles
would take me with him for a sunrise sail before
Mother would need us, and I shall never, never forget
the beauty of the awakening day on that mountain-circled
lake.&rdquo; All this was told to Jenny, who
had seated herself on another rock a little apart from
the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>Gwyn found herself thinking it strange that
ranchers from Dakota should have the entree to
Tahoe Inn, which she knew to be exclusive. Then
she had to confess that she, herself, had always
associated with only the first families, and yet she
now was seated on the rocks with two girls far
beneath her socially. She flushed as she had to
acknowledge that she was there just to please
Charles Gale. He probably had attracted the girls
who had been at Tahoe Inn as he did her. Her lips,
though she did not know it, were taking on the
customary scornful lines, when Jenny stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming in close this time. Harold
wants to tell us something. Everyone listen hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad, making a trumpet of his hands, was
shouting: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll land next tack. Have some lemonade
for us, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The standing girl nodded her head: then, holding
out a hand to Lenora, said: &ldquo;That command shall
be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More formally, though in a tone of friendliness,
Jenny turned to the other girl: &ldquo;You will go with
us, will you not, Miss Poindexter-Jones? I&rsquo;ll gather
some fresh lemons and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; her face brightened as
she added: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set the rustic table out under the
trees near the hammock, and serve some of those
little cakes Grandma made this morning, and we
might even have strawberries. I gathered many
more than we&rsquo;ll need for the shortcake for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That will be jolly fun!&rdquo; Jenny&rsquo;s enthusiasm
was contagious as far as Lenora was concerned,
and so all three girls walked toward the house, two
of them eagerly, but one reluctantly. Why didn&rsquo;t
she have the courage to say that she must go to her
own home? What excuse could she give that would
be the truth, for, strangely enough, Gwynette
scorned falsehood. She had been angry with herself
ever since she had made the excuse of the dress,
knowing that it had not been true. Though they
did not know it, that high sense of honesty these
two girls had inherited from their missionary father.</p>
<p>While she was struggling with her desire to be
one of the party when Charles should have landed,
and her disinclination at being with girls far beneath
her socially, Jenny, who was a little in the
lead, turned and smilingly addressed her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Poindexter-Jones, what would you prefer
doing&mdash;hulling strawberries, making the lemonade
or setting the table under the trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora, who was bringing up the rear of the
little procession, smiled to herself. Jenny surely was
daring, for, as they both well knew, Gwynette would
not <i>prefer</i> to do anything at all. Surely she would
now find some excuse for hasty retreat. She might
go home and read to her mother if she had awakened.
This Gwyn decided to tell them, but when
she did hear her own voice it was saying: &ldquo;If I may
choose, I prefer to set the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Jenny turned to Lenora: &ldquo;Dearie, shall
you mind staining your fingers rosy red?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strawberry red, you mean, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Lenora
dropped down on the top step of the front porch,
adding with an upward smile: &ldquo;Sister Jenny, bring
the fruit and I will hull with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right-o.&rdquo; Then to the other girl, who stood
stiffly erect, Jenny said very sweetly: &ldquo;If you will
come with me, I&rsquo;ll show you where Grandmother
Sue keeps her best china. I know that she will let
us use it for this gala occasion.&rdquo; Then pointing:
&ldquo;See over there, by the hammock, is the little rustic
table. There are five of us. I&rsquo;ll bring out five
chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Lenora put in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d far rather luxuriate
in the hammock. Anyway, four chairs even up the
table better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn removed her hat, and followed Jenny
toward the kitchen, where in an old-fashioned china
closet there were some very pretty dishes. The ware
was thin and the fern pattern was attractive, and
suitable for an out-of-door tea party.</p>
<p>For the next fifteen minutes these three girls were
busy, and to Gwynette&rsquo;s surprise she was actually
enjoying her share of the preparations. After setting
the table with a lunch cloth and the pretty
dishes, she gathered a cluster of pink wild roses for
the center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love those single roses!&rdquo; Jenny exclaimed
when she brought out a large glass pitcher of lemonade
on which were floating strips of peel. &ldquo;They
are so simple and&mdash;well&mdash;just what they really are,
not pretending anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora appeared with a glass dish heaped with
luscious strawberries. Their hostess was surely in
an appreciative mood. &ldquo;O-o-h! Don&rsquo;t they look
simply luscious under all that powdered sugar?
Those sailors don&rsquo;t know the treat that&rsquo;s in store
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for us!&rdquo; It was Gwyn&rsquo;s first impulsive
remark. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that I was hungry, but I feel
now as though I were famished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we!&rdquo; A hearty voice behind caused them
all to turn, and there were the two boys who had
stolen up quietly on purpose to surprise the girls.
&ldquo;We landed at the cabin, so we are all washed up
and ready for the &lsquo;eats&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it truly was a feast of merriment. Gwyn
was surprised to find herself laughing with the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>Lenora, half reclining in the hammock, was more
an observer than a partaker of the active merriment.
From her position she could see the profiles of the
two girls at the table. They were both dressed in
yellow, for Jenny had on her favorite muslin. The
shade was somewhat different from Gwyn&rsquo;s corn-colored
linen, but the effect was startlingly similar.
They had both removed their hats and their hair
was exactly the same soft waving light brown, with
gold glints in it. Indeed, it might have been hair
on one head. Charles and Harold, of course, had
also noted this at an earlier period, but it was
Lenora&rsquo;s first opportunity to study the two girls.
What <i>could</i> it mean? <i>It</i> was too decided a likeness
to be merely a coincident. She determined to ask
Charles.</p>
<p>That lad was devoting his time and thought to
drawing Gwyn out of the formal stiffness which
had been evident when the little party started. This
he did, for Gwyn had had years of practice at clever
repartee, and so also had Charles, for, as she knew,
he had associated with the daughters of cultured
families and also, of course, with the sons.</p>
<p>Jenny and Harold, seated opposite each other,
now and then exchanged glances that ranged from
amusement to gratification. They were both decidedly
pleased that the difficult guest was being
entertained.</p>
<p>When at last the strawberries, cakes and lemonade
had disappeared, Harold sprang up, announcing
that, since the young ladies had prepared the party,
the young gentlemen would do the doing that was to
follow. Charles instantly began to pile dishes high,
saying in a gay tone, directly to Gwyn, &ldquo;I suppose
you hadn&rsquo;t heard that I am &lsquo;hasher&rsquo; now and then at
our frat &lsquo;feeds&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>The girl shuddered. &ldquo;No, I had not.&rdquo; Her reply
was so cold and her manner again so formal that
Lenora put in rebukingly: &ldquo;Charles, why do you
say that? Of course I think it is splendid of boys
who have to work their way through college to do
anything at all that they can, but father insisted that
you pay your way, that you might have your entire
time for studying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Sis, dear, but it&rsquo;s the truth, nevertheless,
that we all take turns helping out when there is need
of it, and so I have learned the knack and I&rsquo;m glad
to have it. One can&rsquo;t learn too many things in this
old world of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn rose, saying not without a hint of her old
disdainful hauteur, &ldquo;I am going now. Mother may
be awake and wishing me to read to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, she may,&rdquo; Harold put in. &ldquo;Otherwise
I would remind you that it is not mannerly to
eat and run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sister flushed, and Charles, suspecting that
an angry reply was on the tip of her tongue, hurried
to suggest: &ldquo;Miss Gwyn, if you will wait until I
have finished helping clear up, I&rsquo;ll sail you home,
with Harold&rsquo;s permission. We left the boat at the
cabin dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you go at once,&rdquo; the other lad remarked,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a whole lot rather have Jenny wipe the dishes
while I wash them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Then I can take a nap in this comfy
hammock,&rdquo; Lenora put in. &ldquo;This is the most dissipating
I&rsquo;ve done since I was first taken ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles was at once solicitous and Jenny half
rebukeful. &ldquo;Oh, Lenora. I do hope you aren&rsquo;t overtired,&rdquo;
they both said in different ways.</p>
<p>Lenora curled down among the pillows that she
always had with her. &ldquo;Indeed not! I&rsquo;ll be well
enough to travel home one week from today,&rdquo; she
assured her brother. &ldquo;Now do go, everybody, and
let me sleep.&rdquo; And so, after bidding good-bye to
Jenny and Lenora in a far more friendly manner
than her wont, Gwyn, her heart again singing a
joyous song she could not understand, walked along
the cliff trail, a young giant at her side. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only
the son of a Dakota rancher,&rdquo; a thought tried to
whisper to Gwyn. &ldquo;What care I?&rdquo; was her retort
as she flashed a smile of good comradeship up at the
young man, who, she found, was watching her with
unmistakable admiration in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be alive this beautiful day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
was all that he said.</p>
<p>When Charles returned to the farm, he found
Lenora still in the hammock awakening from a most
refreshing nap. She held out a hand and took it
lovingly as he sat on one of the chairs that had been
about the rustic table. Lenora spoke in a low voice.
&ldquo;Jenny isn&rsquo;t near, is she, brother?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere in sight Why? Shall I call her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;I wanted to ask you
a question and I didn&rsquo;t wish her to hear.&rdquo; Charles
was puzzled; then troubled to know how to answer
when he heard Lenora&rsquo;s question: &ldquo;Have you noticed
the close resemblance between Jenny and Harold&rsquo;s
sister? They might almost be twins if Gwynette
were not two years the older. I think it is simply
amazing. Their profiles are startlingly similar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I noticed the resemblance at once.&rdquo;
Charles was glad to be able to add, &ldquo;Here comes
Harold!&rdquo; Excusing himself, he ran lightly across
the grass to meet his friend. In a low voice he explained
that his sister had discovered the resemblance
and was amazed at it. His listener said:
&ldquo;Suppose we let her into the secret. Perhaps she
can help us to induce Gwyn and Jenny at least to
like each other.&rdquo; Harold was sure that his mother
would not mind, as she had said she would trust
everything to his judgment. &ldquo;I will carry the chairs
in. That will leave you alone to explain as you
think best,&rdquo; he concluded after a merry greeting to
the girl in the hammock. Harold took three of the
chairs and went back to the kitchen. Charles sat
again in the fourth chair and took his sister&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Dear girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have received permission
from Harold to share with you a secret which is of
a very serious nature.&rdquo; Lenora glanced up puzzled
and interested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>Then, very simply, Charles told the whole story.
The girl&rsquo;s first comment was, &ldquo;Poor Gwyn! She
has had a most unfortunate bringing up, and, if she
were now to learn the truth, it would crush her.
She might run away and do something desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what Harold fears, and so he has
asked his mother to permit him to have two weeks
to think over what would be best to do. He feels
encouraged for Gwynette has twice been over here
quite of her own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lenora shook her head. &ldquo;There is nothing
really encouraging about that, for she did not come
to be with Jenny. She came because she likes you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles smiled and surprised Lenora by replying,
&ldquo;And I like Gwynette. She&rsquo;s nicer, really, than she
knows.&rdquo; Again there was an interruption. This
time both Jenny and Harold appeared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time
to milk the cow,&rdquo; the younger lad announced with
the broadest smile. &ldquo;Charles, it&rsquo;s your turn tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are both too late,&rdquo; Jenny told them, &ldquo;for
Grandpa Si took the pail out of the milkroom ten
minutes ago and by this time it is brimming, I am
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>Charles rose. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m rather glad, as I wish
to take a swim before arraying myself for the ball.&rdquo;
Noting his sister&rsquo;s questioning expression, he informed
her that Gwynette and he were going to a
dance at the Yacht Club House that night. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you go with them, Harold?&rdquo; It was Jenny
inquiring. &ldquo;I have often heard you say that you
like to dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do. If you and Lenora will accompany me,
I&rsquo;ll go only too gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be asleep before it
would be time to start,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
go with him, Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That pretty maid&rsquo;s laughter was amused and
merry. &ldquo;Would I wear my yellow muslin or my
white with the pink sprig? Lenora Gale, you know
that I haven&rsquo;t a party dress, nor do I know how to
dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold put in: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not go tonight, but if
Grandma Sue has no religious scruples, I&rsquo;ll come
over after dinner and give you a first lesson in
modern dancing.&rdquo; Then the two boys went cabin-ward
for their afternoon swim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<h2 id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><span class="small">GWYNETTE&rsquo;S CHOICE</span></h2>
<p>Jenny Warner could not guess why there were
so many mysterious smiles and head noddings that
night at supper and the next morning at breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just know that you&rsquo;re all up to mischief,&rdquo; she
accused as they were leaving the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess what we four are going to do this morning,&rdquo;
Lenora beamed at her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know Granddad is going into town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Grandma Sue, you, and I are going with
him,&rdquo; Lenora laughingly told Jenny.</p>
<p>Jenny caught the glance that passed between
Grandma Sue and Lenora and knew they had a
secret.</p>
<p>When an hour later Grandpa Warner stopped
Dobbin in front of the most fashionable store in
Santa Barbara, Jenny was more puzzled than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, sister mine.&rdquo; Lenora took Jenny&rsquo;s
hand and the two girls and Grandma Sue entered
the store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>It was all very mysterious and exciting to Jenny.
She looked at Grandma Sue who gazed about at
the rainbow-hued silks piled high on the counters, at
the display of exquisite laces, and at the dainty silk
lingerie, as though she were visiting a museum.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a power o&rsquo; pretty things in this here shop,&rdquo;
she confided to her companions.</p>
<p>Lenora, having spoken to a uniformed attendant,
led them at once to an elevator and they were silently
and swiftly lifted to an upper floor.</p>
<p>There Jenny saw a handsomely furnished room
with glass cases around the walls, and in them hung
dresses of every color and kind. She decided that
Lenora needed something new to wear on her long
journey, which was only five days away, and so she
sat with Susan Warner on a velvet upholstered sofa
while the other girl spoke quietly with a trim-looking
clerk who was dressed in black with white lace collar
and cuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. We have the very latest things in
party gowns.&rdquo; Jenny could not help overhearing
this remark. The clerk continued: &ldquo;If you will
come this way, I will show them to you.&rdquo; Susan
Warner was on her feet as soon as Lenora beckoned.
Jenny was more mystified than ever. Lenora did
not need a party gown, of that she was sure, for
were there not two as pretty as any girl could wish
to possess hanging in her closet at the farm?</p>
<p>The saleswoman led them to a small room furnished
in old gold and blue. The walls were paneled
with gilt-framed mirrors, and here the attendant left
them. Susan Warner sat down smiling as she noted
Jenny&rsquo;s perplexity. That little maid could keep quiet
no longer. &ldquo;<i>Who</i> is going to buy a party gown,&rdquo;
she inquired. &ldquo;Lenora doesn&rsquo;t need another, and
Grandma Sue, I&rsquo;m sure it can&rsquo;t be <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, Miss Jeanette Warner,&rdquo; Lenora
whispered. &ldquo;Sssh! Don&rsquo;t act surprised, for if you
do, what will the saleswoman think? Now, what
color would you prefer, blue or yellow are both
becoming to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny turned toward the older woman. &ldquo;Grandma
Sue,&rdquo; she began, when the clerk reappeared with
an armful of exquisite gowns of every hue. So there
was nothing for Jenny to do but try on one and then
another. How lovely, how wonderfully lovely they
were, but with a blue silk, the color of forget-me-nots,
she had fallen in love at once. It was trimmed
with shirred blue lovers&rsquo; knots, looping it in here
and there, and with clusters of tiny pink silk roses.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take that,&rdquo; Grandma Sue announced, not
once having asked the price. Jenny gasped. The
saleswoman&rsquo;s well-trained features did not register
the astonishment she felt. Susan Warner did not
give the impression of wealth or fashion, but one
never could tell. The truth was that Lenora had
told the clerk not to mention the price, fearing that
Jenny would refuse the party dress, which was to
be a gift to her from the two Gales. When they
emerged from the shop, the lovely gown carefully
folded in a long box, Jenny was again surprised to
find Harold and Charles standing by the curb visiting
with her grandfather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, wall, Jenny-gal, did they get you fixed up
with fancy riggin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandpa Si beamed at the darling of his heart.</p>
<p>The girl looked as though she were walking in a
dream. It all seemed very unreal to her. &ldquo;Oh, it is
the loveliest dress!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;but wherever
am I to wear it? I <i>never</i> went to a party, so why
do I need a party gown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see what you shall see,&rdquo; was Harold&rsquo;s
mysterious reply. Then he added briskly, &ldquo;Now
since we happened to meet you, will you not honor
us with your company for lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed we will.&rdquo; Lenora, twinkling-eyed,
was evidently carrying out a prearranged conversation.
&ldquo;Just lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An attractive caf&eacute; being near, the party, led thither
by Harold, was soon seated at a table in a curtained
booth.</p>
<p>Silas Warner beamed across at his good wife.
&ldquo;Sort o&rsquo; hifalutin doin&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re up to, hey, Ma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Warner&rsquo;s cheeks were flushed, her eyes
sparkling. &ldquo;It sure is a treat to me to know what&rsquo;s
on the inside of these places. Will yo&rsquo; hear that
now? There&rsquo;s a fiddle startin&rsquo; up somewhars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>The &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; was not alone, for an orchestra
played during their entire stay. The boys were told
to order the lunch, and they seemed to get a good
deal of enjoyment out of doing it. They selected
delicacies with long French names, but Grandpa Si,
who by that time had removed his hat, since the
boys had done so, ate everything that was brought
to him with a relish, smacking his lips appreciatively
and asking, &ldquo;Wall, Ma, do yo&rsquo; reckon <i>you</i> could
make one o&rsquo; them concoctions if the waiter&rsquo;d tell
you what the mixin&rsquo;s was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas Warner, don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; go to askin&rsquo; him,&rdquo; Susan
warned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re greener than we be,
even though that&rsquo;s green enough, goodness knows,
when it comes to puttin&rsquo; on sech styles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man leaned over and patted his wife&rsquo;s
hand, which was still partly covered with the black
lace mit. &ldquo;Ma, don&rsquo; yo&rsquo; go to frettin&rsquo; about me.
I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to ask nothin&rsquo; an&rsquo;, as fer the vittles,
thar&rsquo;s none as can cook more to <i>my</i> likin&rsquo; than yerself,
even though thar be less trimmin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was while they were eating their ice cream and
cake that Harold suggested that they go to the theatre.
It was quite evident that the old people were
delighted and so were the girls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid
play,&rdquo; Charles put in. &ldquo;I do wish your sister had
come with us.&rdquo; Harold had purposely neglected to
tell his friend of the conversation he had had that
morning with Gwynette.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>As they were leaving the caf&eacute;, Charles asked,
&ldquo;Should you mind, Hal, if I borrow your little gray
car and go back after Gwynette? I&rsquo;m sure she
would enjoy the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go by all means.&rdquo; Harold drew his friend aside,
although not seeming to do so, as he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
a box for the Warners and Lenora. You would
better get seats somewhere else for you and Gwyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Charles questioned. &ldquo;There is usually
room for eight at least in a box. Are they smaller
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm! I understand. Well, just leave that to
me. So long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gwyn had been feeling decidedly neglected.
She had read to her mother in the garden
as had become their morning custom but the older
woman noted that the girl was listless and disinterested.
&ldquo;Ma Mere,&rdquo; Gwyn had said, dropping the
book to her lap, and showing by her remark that
she had not been thinking of the story. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t
too late I believe I will go on that tour you were
telling me about. I am desperately unhappy. Something
is all wrong with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poindexter-Jones sighed. &ldquo;I am sorry,
Gwyn. It is too late dear, but perhaps I will hear
of another. I will make inquiries if you wish.&rdquo;
Then Miss Dane had come to take the invalid indoors,
and Gwyn spent a lonely hour lunching by
herself in the great formal dining-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>It was in the library that Charles found her. She
had been trying to read, but oh, how eagerly she
glanced up when she heard his step. The lad
bounded in, both hands held out. There was an expression
in his fine eyes that rejoiced the girl&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been so dismally lonely,&rdquo; Gwyn said,
and there were tears of self-pity on her long curling
lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl I know what it is to be lonely.&rdquo; Then,
with one of his most winsome smiles, Charles
added, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I have come back for you,
Gwyn.&rdquo; It was the first time he had called her that.
&ldquo;The others were going to the theatre. Harold&rsquo;s
to get a box. I couldn&rsquo;t enjoy the play without you
there&mdash;that is, not if you would like to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn was torn between a desire to be with Charles
Gale and a dread of being seen in a box with these
impossible Warners. &ldquo;Oh, Charles!&rdquo; They were
calling each other by their first names without realizing
it. &ldquo;I want to go with <i>you</i>! I am always <i>proud</i>
of you anywhere, but&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated and looked
up at him almost pleadingly, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t like me
when I tell you that I would be <i>ashamed</i> to be seen
in a box&mdash;with my mother&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>Charles released her hands and walked to a window,
where he stood silently looking out. &ldquo;Gwyn,&rdquo;
he said, turning toward her, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I
would ever meet a girl for whom I would care&mdash;<i>really
care</i>, but I know now that I have met one,
but, since she scorns farmers, I shall have to cease
caring, for I by <i>choice</i> am, and shall remain, a
farmer, or a rancher, as we are called in the Northwest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn&rsquo;s heart beat rapidly. Was this handsome
young man, who stood so proudly erect, telling her
that he loved her? And in that moment she knew
that she cared for him. She felt scornful of herself,
for, had she not often boasted that the most
eligible bachelor in San Francisco&rsquo;s younger set
would be the one of <i>her choice</i>, nor, had she any
doubt but that <i>she</i> would also be his, and here she
was silently acknowledging that she loved a mere
rancher. However, it might be with her but a passing
fancy. He would be gone in another week;
then she would visit the city and meet men of her
<i>own</i> class and forget. Yes, that is what she really
<i>wanted</i> to do, <i>forget</i> this unsuitable attraction.</p>
<p>Charles broke in upon her meditations with,
&ldquo;Well, Gwyn, time is passing. Do you care to go
to the matinee with me and occupy a box with the
Warners, my sister and Harold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proud girl felt that he was making this a
test of whether or not she could care for him as a
rancher. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she heard her voice saying coldly.
&ldquo;I would rather be lonely than be seen in a box with
those back-woodsy Warners.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I must return at once or I will be
late.&rdquo; Charles started for the door. Gwyn sensed,
and truly, that her &ldquo;no&rdquo; meant a refusal of more
than an afternoon at the matinee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he turned in the portier-hung doorway
to say. He saw that she had dropped to the
sofa and, hiding her face in a cushion, was sobbing
as though her heart would break. One stride took
him back to her. &ldquo;Gwyn! Dear, dear girl!&rdquo; He
sat beside her and took both of her hands, but she
continued to look away from him. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t
you try to overcome these petty false standards?
I <i>want</i> to ask you to be my wife, but I can&rsquo;t, when
you think a rancher so far beneath you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, she lifted a glowing face. &ldquo;<i>I want</i>
to be a rancher&rsquo;s wife. Charles, please let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curtain had gone down on the first act when
Gwynette and Charles appeared in the box. They
were welcomed with smiles and nods and a few
whispered words. Harold, from time to time,
glanced back at his sister. She was positively radiant.
Then he caught a look full of meaning that
was exchanged by the girl and the man at her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>It told its own story. Gwynette, the proud,
haughty, domineering girl, had been won by a
rancher. Her brother well knew how she had struggled
against what she would call a misalliance, but
Cupid had been the victor. Then he wondered what
his mother would say. Involuntarily Harold glanced
at the girl near whom he was sitting. Feeling his
glance, she smiled up at him, and yet it was merely
a smile of good comradeship. He would have to
wait. Jenny was two years younger than her sister,
and had never thought of love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<h2 id="c34">CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><span class="small">AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE</span></h2>
<p>Gwynette went about in a dream. She and
Charles had been for a sunrise sail (as Lenora had
said that she and her brother had so often been on
Lake Tahoe) and they had made their plans.
Charles was to return to the Dakota ranch on scheduled
time and work with his father during the
summer, then, in the fall, he would return for his
bride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you change your mind and wish to marry
someone in your <i>own</i> class,&rdquo; he said, as hand in
hand they returned to the big house. The girl
flushed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she pleaded. Then, &ldquo;I want to
forget how worthless were my old ideals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t even marry the younger son
of a noble English family, in preference to me, I
mean, if you knew one and he asked you?&rdquo; Gwyn
thought the query a strange one, but looked up,
replying with sweet sincerity: &ldquo;No, Charles, I shall
marry no one but <i>you</i>.&rdquo; Then she laughed. &ldquo;What
a queer question that was. A young nobleman is
not very apt to ask <i>me</i> to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>There was a merry expression on the lad&rsquo;s handsome,
wind and sun tanned face as he said: &ldquo;Wrong
there, Gwynette, for one <i>has</i> asked you.&rdquo; Then,
when he thought that he had mysterified her
sufficiently, he continued: &ldquo;Did you ever hear it
rumored that a pupil of the Granger Place Seminary
might, some day, have the right to the title
&lsquo;My Lady&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn flushed. Even yet she did <i>not</i> suspect the
truth, and she feared Harold had told of her humiliation
in giving a ball at The Palms in honor of a
supposed daughter of nobility whose father proved
to be a pigraiser. Rather coldly she said, &ldquo;I had
heard such a rumor, but we all decided that it was
untrue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t. Were my sister in England she
would be called &lsquo;Lady Lenora.&rsquo; Our uncle died last
winter and father is now in possession of the family
estates and title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl flushed and tears rushed to her eyes.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me all this sooner?&rdquo; she asked,
and the lad replied: &ldquo;I had two reasons. One was
that I wished to be loved just for myself, and the
other was that I do not care to marry a snob.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>Then he had bounded away to breakfast with
Harold at the cabin and to don his overalls, for, not
one morning had the boys neglected to appear at the
farm, on time, to help Grandpa Si.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was the hour for Gwyn to read to her mother,
who was already waiting in the pond-lily garden.
The woman, much stronger than she had been, was
amazed to see the joy so plainly depicted on the
beautiful face of her adopted daughter. She held
out a hand that was as white as the lilies on the blue
surface of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwynette, dear girl, what <i>has</i> so transformed
you?&rdquo; To the woman&rsquo;s surprise, Gwyn dropped
down on the low stool and, taking her hand, pressed
it close to her cheek. &ldquo;Mother dear, I am so happy,
so wonderfully happy! But I don&rsquo;t deserve it! I
have always been so hateful. How could I have
won so priceless a treasure as the love of Charles
Gale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were conflicting emotions in the heart of
the listener. She had had dreams of Gwynette&rsquo;s
coming-out party which they had planned for the
next winter. Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had often
thought over the eligibles for whom she would
angle, after the fashion of mothers with beautiful
daughters, and here the matter had all been settled
without her knowledge and Gwyn was to marry a
rancher&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said tenderly, smoothing
the girl&rsquo;s sun-glinted hair, &ldquo;are you <i>sure</i> that
you love him? With your beauty you could have
won wealth and position.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>How glowing was the face that was lifted.
&ldquo;Mother, I <i>chose</i> love, and have won a far higher
social pinnacle than <i>you</i> ever dreamed for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the story had been told Mrs. Poindexter-Jones,
notwithstanding her changed ideals, was
nevertheless pleased. She leaned forward and kissed
her daughter tenderly. &ldquo;Dear girl,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
am especially glad that, first of all, you chose love.
I did when I married your father, but the great
mistake I made was continuing to be a snob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn arose. &ldquo;I shall <i>not</i>, Mother, and to prove
it, I shall go this afternoon to call upon the
Warners.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<h2 id="c35">CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><span class="small">A BIRTHDAY CAKE</span></h2>
<p>Miss Dearborn had returned to Hillcrest, and
with her were a small girl and boy, the children of
her dear college friend, who, with her baby, had
been taken from this world. Jenny, with Lenora,
had gone that afternoon to see her and had learned
that Miss Dearborn was to make a home for the
little ones for a year, during which time their father
was to tour the world, then he would return and
make a home for them himself. Neither Miss Dearborn
nor Jenny spoke their thoughts, but oh, <i>how</i>
the girl hoped that there would then be a happy
ending to Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s long years of sacrifice.
If the young woman were thinking of this, her next
remark did not suggest it. &ldquo;Jenny, dear, we will
have three classes in our little school next year to
suit the ages of my three pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>Then it was that Lenora said impulsively, &ldquo;How
I do wish, Miss Dearborn, that you could take still
another pupil. My father and brother think best to
have me spend the winter in California. Our Dakota
storms are so severe. I am to live with the Warners
just as I have been doing this past two
months.&rdquo; Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s reply was enthusiastic
and sincere: &ldquo;Splendid! That will make our little
school complete. I know how Jenny will enjoy your
companionship. She has often told me that if she
had had the choosing of a sister, she would have
been just like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora glanced quickly at the speaker, wondering
if Miss Dearborn <i>knew</i> who Jenny&rsquo;s <i>real</i> sister was,
but just then the little Austin girl ran to her
&ldquo;auntie&rdquo; with a doll&rsquo;s sash to be tied, and the subject
was changed.</p>
<p>On that ride home behind Dobbin, Lenora wondered
if Jenny would ever learn that Gwyn was her
real sister. Charles had confided in her, and so she
knew that in the autumn Gwynette would be <i>her</i>
sister by marriage and that would draw Jenny and
Lenora closer than ever. How she wished that she
could tell Jenny everything she knew, but she had
promised that she would not. When the girls returned
home they found Susan Warner much excited
about something. Gwynette had been over to
call, <i>actually</i> to call, and she had remained on the
side porch visiting with Grandma Sue even when
she had learned that Jenny and Lenora had driven
to Miss Dearborn&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n that, she left an invite for <i>all</i> of us to
come to a party Mrs. Poindexter-Jones is givin&rsquo; on
Charles&rsquo; birthday. Gwyn said she hoped I&rsquo;d make
the chocolate cake with twenty-one layers like Harold
wanted, just the same, but we&rsquo;d have the party
over to the big house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, at first, looked disappointed. Then her
expression changed to one of delight. Clasping her
hands, she cried, &ldquo;Oh, Grandma Sue, <i>that</i> will be a
<i>real</i> party, won&rsquo;t it, and I can wear the beautiful
new dress Lenora has given me. I was afraid I
never, <i>never</i> would have a chance to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman nodded. Then she confided:
&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s some queer change has come over Gwynette
Poindexter-Jones, and I&rsquo;ll say this much for her,
she&rsquo;s a whole sight nicer&rsquo;n she <i>was</i>, for it, whatever
&rsquo;tis. I reckon her ma&rsquo;s glad. I cal&rsquo;late, on the
whole, she&rsquo;s been sort o&rsquo; disappointed in her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>Then Jenny astonished them by saying: &ldquo;Gwyn
is a beautiful girl. No one knows how I want her
to love me.&rdquo; Susan Warner looked up almost suspiciously
from the peas that she was shelling. That
was a queer thing for Jenny to say, and even after
the girls had gone indoors, that Lenora might rest,
Susan Warner thought over and over again, now
of the yearning tone in which Jenny had spoken,
and then of the words, &ldquo;No one knows how I <i>want</i>
her to love me.&rdquo; <i>What</i> could it mean? There
wasn&rsquo;t any possible way for Jenny to know that she
and Gwyn were sisters. Tears sprang to Susan&rsquo;s
eyes unbidden. &ldquo;If she ever learns that, she&rsquo;ll have
to know Si and me ain&rsquo;t her grandparents.&rdquo; Then
the old woman rebuked her selfishness. &ldquo;I reckon
Si was right when he said &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t make a mite
o&rsquo; difference in Jenny&rsquo;s carin&rsquo; for us. Si said <i>nothing</i>
could.&rdquo; But her hands shook when, a few
moments later, she dumped the shelled peas into the
pot of bubbling water that was waiting to receive
them. Taking up one corner of her apron, she
wiped her eyes. Jenny had entered the kitchen. At
once her strong young arms were about the old
woman, and there was sweet assurance in her words:
&ldquo;Grandma Sue, I love you.&rdquo; Then, after pressing
her fresh young cheek for a long, silent moment
against the one that was softly wrinkled, the girl
held the old woman at arm&rsquo;s length as she joyfully
cried, &ldquo;Oh, Grandma Sue, isn&rsquo;t it wonderful, <i>wonderful</i>,
that you and Grandpa Si and Lenora and I
are going to a real party, the very first one that
I have ever attended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old woman protested. &ldquo;Now, dearie,
Grandpa Si an&rsquo; me ain&rsquo;t plannin&rsquo; to go along of you
young folks. &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be right, no ways you look
at it, us bein&rsquo; hired by Mrs. Poindexter-Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>The brightness faded from Jenny&rsquo;s flower-like
face. She stepped back and shook a warning finger
at her companion. Her tone expressed finality.
&ldquo;Very well, Mrs. Susan Warner, then we might as
well take the party gown back to the shop it came
from, for, if you and Granddad aren&rsquo;t good enough
to attend Gwynette&rsquo;s party, neither am I. So the
matter is settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the argifyin&rsquo;?&rdquo; a genial voice inquired
from the open door, and there, coming in with a
brimming pail of milk, was Grandpa Si.</p>
<p>Jenny turned and flung at him her ultimatum.
The old man pushed his straw hat back on his head
and his leathery face wrinkled in a smile. &ldquo;Ma,&rdquo;
he said, addressing his wife, &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d be on
your side if &rsquo;twan&rsquo;t that I give my word of honor
to Harry and Charles, and now it&rsquo;s give, I&rsquo;ll not go
back on it. They said &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be no party to
them if you&rsquo;n me weren&rsquo;t at it. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more,
Mrs. Poindexter-Jones sent Harry over special to
give us a bid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny nodded her golden brown head emphatically.
&ldquo;There, now, that&rsquo;s settled. Oh, good, here&rsquo;s
Lenora, looking fresh as a daisy from her long nap.&rdquo;
Then, beaming at the pretty newcomer, she exclaimed,
&ldquo;Come this way, Miss Gale, if you want
to see Grandma&rsquo;s masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, Jenny-gal; &rsquo;twan&rsquo;t me that prettied
it up,&rdquo; the old woman protested. Jenny threw open
a pantry door, and there, on a wide shelf, stood a
mountain of a chocolate cake. &ldquo;Honestly, there are
twenty-one layers. They&rsquo;re thin, to be sure, but
light as feathers, for I ate up the sample. And the
chocolate filling is just foamy with whipped cream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful it is.&rdquo; There were tears in
Lenora&rsquo;s eyes, as she added wistfully: &ldquo;How I wish
our dear mother could see the cake you have made
for her son&rsquo;s twenty-first birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, going closer, she added, admiringly, &ldquo;Why,
Jenny, however did you make those white frosted
letters and the wreath of flowers? They look like
orange blossoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny flashed a smile of triumph around at her
grandparents. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t
<i>that</i> prove that I am an artist born? Miss Gale
recognizes flowers. See, here is the spray I was
copying. We&rsquo;re going to put a wreath of real blossoms
around the edge of the plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought orange blossoms meant a wedding&mdash;&rdquo;
Lenora began. She wondered if Charles&rsquo;
secret was known, but Jenny, in a matter of fact
way, replied: &ldquo;A twenty-first birthday is equally
important. Our only other choice would have been
lemon blossoms, and, somehow, <i>they</i> didn&rsquo;t seem
quite appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Sue had again busied herself at the
stove, while Grandpa Si strained the milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, girls,&rdquo; she now called, &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s done
to a turn. You&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; a deal o&rsquo; time to prink,
I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>The old man removed his straw hat, washed at
the sink pump, and, as he was rubbing his face with
the towel, his eyes twinkled above it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late it&rsquo;ll take quite a spell for me&rsquo;n you to
rig up for this here ball, Susie-wife,&rdquo; he said as he
took his place at the head of the table.</p>
<p>The old woman, at the other end, shook her gray
curls as she protested: &ldquo;I sort o&rsquo; wish yo&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t
been so hasty, makin&rsquo; a promise on your honor like
that to Harry. We&rsquo;ll feel old-fashioned, and in the
way, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I&rsquo;m sort o&rsquo; squeamish about it myself, but
the word of Si Warner can&rsquo;t be took back.&rdquo; The
old man tried to assume a repentant expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fraud, Grandpa Si!&rdquo; Jenny laughed
across at him. &ldquo;I can see by the twinkle in your
eyes that you intend to lead the dance tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Such a merry, exciting time as they had in the
two hours that followed. Jenny insisted on helping
her grandparents to dress in their best before she
donned her party gown. Grandma Sue had a black
silk which had been turned and made over several
times, but, being of the best of material, it had not
grown shabby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old Mrs. Jones gave it to me,&rdquo; she told Lenora,
&ldquo;when Si and I were figgerin&rsquo; on gettin&rsquo; married.&rdquo;
Susan Warner&rsquo;s cheeks were apple-red with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grandma Sue,&rdquo; Lenora suddenly exclaimed,
&ldquo;I have the prettiest creamy lace shawl. It belonged
to my grandmother, and there&rsquo;s a head-dress to go
with it. She&rsquo;d just love to have you wear it. Won&rsquo;t
you, to please me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I will if you&rsquo;re hankerin&rsquo; to have me.&rdquo;
Lenora darted to her trunk and soon returned with
a small but very beautiful shoulder shawl of creamy
lace, and a smaller lace square with a pale lavender
bow which she placed atop of Susan Warner&rsquo;s gray
curls. Grandpa Si arrived, dressed in his best black,
in time to join in the general chorus of admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma Sue, you&rsquo;ll be the belle of the ball!&rdquo;
Jenny kissed both of the flushed cheeks, then flew
to her room, for Lenora was calling her to make
haste or their escort would arrive before they were
ready. And that was just what happened, for, ten
minutes later, wheels were heard without, and a big
closed car stopped at the side porch. Harold bounded
in, and, when he saw Grandma Sue, he declared that
none of the younger guests would be able to hold a
candle to her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blarneyin&rsquo; batch you are.&rdquo;
The old woman was nevertheless pleased. A moment
later Jenny appeared, arrayed in her blue silk party
gown, her glinting gold-brown hair done up higher
than ever before, and her flower-like face aglow.
For a moment Harold could not speak. He had not
dreamed that she could be so beautiful. Then
Lenora came, looking very sweet indeed in a rose
chiffon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silas,&rdquo; Grandma Sue directed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to
set up front, along of Harry, an&rsquo; hold the cake on
you&rsquo;re knees. I do hope &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t slide off. It&rsquo;s sort
o&rsquo; ticklish, carryin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in due time the big house was reached, and
the cake was left at the basement kitchen door.
Jenny felt a thrill of excitement course over her, yet
even she could not know how momentous <i>that</i> evening
was to be in her <i>own</i> life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<h2 id="c36">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><span class="small">SISTERS</span></h2>
<p>The big house was brilliantly illuminated and yet
there were delightful twilight nooks, half hidden
behind great potted palms which had come from a
florist&rsquo;s in Santa Barbara. Guests had been arriving
in motors from the big city all the afternoon.
Gwynette was in her element. Tom Pinkerton, the
roommate of Charles, had been summoned by phone
to round up a few of their classmates, and be there
for the gala occasion. Gwyn had asked Patricia,
Beulah and a few other girl friends, while Harold
had sent telegraphic invitations to his pals at the
military school. There had only been two days to
perfect arrangements, but had there been a week, the
big house could not have been more attractively
arrayed, for the wisteria arbor was in full bloom and
great bunches of the graceful white and purple blossoms
filled every vase and bowl in the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>There were flowers in each of the ten guest rooms
where the young people who had arrived in the afternoon
had rested until the dinner hour.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The musical chimes were telling the hour of eight
when Harold led his companions into the brilliantly
lighted hall and up to the rooms where they were to
remove their wraps. Jenny glanced through the wide
double doors into the spacious parlors and library
where the chairs and lounges had been placed around
the walls, leaving the floor clear for dancing. Beautifully
dressed girls and young men in evening clothes
sauntered about in couples visiting with old friends
and meeting others. Jenny did not feel real. She
had often read stories describing events like this one,
and she had often imagined that she was a guest.
She almost had to pinch herself as she was ascending
the wide, softly-carpeted stairway to be sure that <i>this</i>
was real and not one of her dreams.</p>
<p>When they had removed their wraps and had
descended, they were greeted by Mrs. Poindexter-Jones,
who, beautifully gowned, sat in her wheeled
chair, with Gwynette, lovely in a filmy blue chiffon,
standing at her side. Miss Dane had reluctantly
consented to permit her patient, who had grown
stronger very rapidly in the last few days, to remain
downstairs for one hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">[304]</div>
<p>When the hidden orchestra began to play, Miss
Dane pushed the invalid chair to a palm-sheltered
nook, wherein Susan Warner and her good man had
at once taken refuge, and there, at their side, the
patrician woman sat watching the young people
dance, talking to her companions from time to time.
Then she asked Miss Dane to tell her daughter that
she would like to speak to her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see her just
now. You may find her in her room. She had forgotten
her necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dane, after glancing about at the dancers,
went upstairs. There was someone in the room
where the wraps had been removed. Rushing in the
open door, the nurse said: &ldquo;Miss Gwynette, your
mother wishes to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned and, smiling in her friendly way,
said, &ldquo;You are mistaken, Miss Dane. I am Jenny
Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dane hesitated, gazing intently at the apparition
before her. &ldquo;Pardon me, Miss Warner,&rdquo; she
then said. &ldquo;It must be because you and Miss Gwynette
are both wearing blue that you look so much
alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away and met Gwyn just ascending
the stairway. The nurse had been so impressed with
the resemblance that she could not refrain from exclaiming
about it. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;you
two girls look near enough alike to be sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn did not feel at all complimented, and her
reply was coldly given. &ldquo;Tell Mother that I will
come to her as soon as I get my necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</div>
<p>Jenny was leaving the bedroom, whither she had
gone for her handkerchief, just as the other girl was
entering. One glance at the haughty, flushed face
of her hostess and the farmer&rsquo;s granddaughter knew
that something of a disturbing nature had occurred,
but she did not dream that she was in any way concerned
in the matter. She was very much surprised to
hear Gwyn saying in her haughtiest manner: &ldquo;Miss
Warner, my mother&rsquo;s nurse tells me that she spoke
to you just now, believing that you were me. I recall
that the girls in the seminary once alluded to a
resemblance they pretended to see.
<a id="frontref" href="#front">Will you do me the favor to stand in front of this long mirror with me,</a>
that I may also find the resemblance, if there is
one, which I doubt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny, her heart fluttering with excitement, stood
beside the older girl and gazed directly at her in
the mirror.</p>
<p>Gwyn continued, appraisingly: &ldquo;Our eyes are
hazel and we both have light brown hair, but so
have many other girls. I cannot understand, can
you, why Miss Dane should have said that we look
near enough alike to be sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On an impulse Jenny replied, &ldquo;Yes, Gwynette, I
can understand, because we <i>are</i> sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Jenny regretted having revealed the long
kept secret, for Gwynette sank down on a lounge
near her, her hand pressed to her heart, every bit of
color receding from her face until she was deathly
pale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</div>
<p>Jenny, all solicitude, exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, are you
going to faint? I ought not to have told you. But
you asked me! Forgive me, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a hard, glinting light between the
arrowed lids of the older girl. &ldquo;Jenny Warner, I do
<i>not</i> believe you! Why should <i>you</i> know more of
<i>my</i> parentage than I do myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly Jenny told the story. She deeply regretted
that her impulsiveness had rendered the revelation
necessary. &ldquo;One stormy day, several years ago,
while I was rummaging around in the attic of the
farmhouse, I found pushed way back in a dark cobwebby
corner a small haircloth trunk which interested
me. I did not think it necessary to ask permission
to open it, as I did not dream that it held a
secret which my dear grandparents might not wish
me to discover, and so I dragged it over to the small
window. Sitting on one of the broken backed chairs,
I lifted the lid. The first thing that I found was a
darling little Bible, bound in soft leather. It was
quaint and old-fashioned. Miss Dearborn had taught
me to love old books, and I at once looked for the
date it had been published, when two things dropped
out. One was a photograph. There were four in
the group. The man was young and reminded me
of Robert Burns; his companion was a very beautiful
girl, and yet under her picture had been written
&lsquo;Mother&rsquo; and under the other &lsquo;Father.&rsquo; I judged
that was because with them were two children. Beneath
them was written, &lsquo;Gwynette, aged three;
Jeanette, just one today.&rsquo; And then there was the
date. The other was an unfinished letter, written in
purple ink that had faded. Its message was very
sad, for it told that the girl-mother had died and the
young wandering missionary, our father, feared that
he had not long to live because of frequent heart
attacks. He wanted his little girls to know that they
came of a New England family that was above reproach,
the Waterburys of Waltham, Mass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How well I remember the last message that dear
hand had been able to write. &lsquo;My darling little baby
girls, I have had another of those dread attacks, but
I do want to say with what strength I have left, as
the years go by, love ye one another.&rsquo; That was all.
Then the pen had fallen, I think, for there was a
blot and an irregular blurred line of ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwyn, crushed with an overwhelming sense of
self-pity, had buried her head in the soft silken
pillows at one end of the lounge and was sobbing,
but Jenny did not try to comfort her, believing that
she could not, and so she continued: &ldquo;I put the letter
and the photograph into the little old Bible and
replaced it. Then I dragged the haircloth trunk back
into its dark corner. I was greatly troubled to know
whether or not I ought to tell grandmother what I
had learned. I asked the advice of my dear teacher
and she said: &lsquo;Do not tell at present, Jeanette. If
your grandmother does not wish you to know, perhaps
it would be wiser to wait until she tells you.
Then she told me that she had a college friend living
in Waltham, and that she would make inquiries
about our family. In time the reply came. Our
father&rsquo;s father and grandfather had been ministers
in high standing, philanthropists and scholars. Our
father had been the last of the family, and, as they
had given all they had to the poor, there was no
money to care for us. Oh, Gwynette!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</div>
<p>Jenny touched the other girl ever so tenderly on
the shoulder. &ldquo;How grateful I have been; how very
much more I have loved my dear adopted grandparents
since I realized what they had saved me
from. Had they not taken me into their home, and
shared with me the best they had, I would have been
sent to a county orphanage, and no one knows to
what fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwynette was sitting erect, her hands crushingly
clasped together. Jenny paused, wondering what
she would say. It was a sincere cry of regret. &ldquo;Oh,
to think how ungrateful I have been to that wonderful
woman who has given me every advantage and
who would have loved me like an own daughter if
I had not been so selfish, ever demanding more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</div>
<p>Gwyn turned and held both hands out to her companion.
&ldquo;Jenny, forgive me. I am not worthy to
call you sister. From this hour, forever, let us carry
out our father&rsquo;s last wish. Let us truly love one
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, she went to her jewel box, took from it the
necklace for which she had come, and turning, she
slipped it about the neck of her companion. Kissing
her flushed cheek, she said: &ldquo;Sister, this is my first
gift to you. Keep it forever in remembrance of this
hour.&rdquo; Then, after removing all traces of tears,
she held out her hand, saying: &ldquo;Come, dear, let us
go down together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poindexter-Jones had wanted to ask Gwynette
if she would like to have her engagement
announced at this party. The woman was amazed
to see the girl&rsquo;s lips quivering. Gwyn bent low to
listen, then, after assenting, she said in a low voice,
tense with feeling. &ldquo;Mother, I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny had slipped at once to the side of Susan
Warner, and held her wrinkled old hand in a loving
clasp. There was an expression in her face they had
never seen before.</p>
<p>Charles Gale, seeing that his fiance had returned,
went at once to her side. The music had stopped,
and Miss Dane pushed the invalid chair forward.
The dancers, standing in groups about, were hushed,
realizing that an announcement of some kind was
to be made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">[310]</div>
<p>Mrs. Poindexter-Jones spoke clearly: &ldquo;Friends
of my daughter and of my son, I have the great
pleasure of announcing Gwynette&rsquo;s engagement to
a young man of whom we are very proud, Charles
Gale of Dakota.&rdquo; Not one word about English
ancestry. Mrs. Poindexter-Jones truly had changed.
Then before the guests could flock about the young
couple to congratulate them, Gwynette had quickly
stepped back, and taking Jenny by the hand, she led
her out to where Charles was standing. Slipping
an arm lovingly about the wondering girl, Gwyn
said, &ldquo;And I wish to introduce to you all my own
dear sister, Jeanette.&rdquo;</p>
